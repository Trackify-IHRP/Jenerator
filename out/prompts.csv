17147 • unknown • NaT • For candidates that are given a reassessment attempt due to this error have to complete both papers. There are 2 possible cause: The candidate was rescheduled to a different mode (RPT to CBT). The candidate was rescheduled to an assessment date that is two months later. Both of these changes will result in a different paper type due to internal paper rotations. Therefore, it is advisable to establish a best practice approach for rescheduling candidates who have partially completed their assessments due to technical issues. Nevertheless, this issue should not surface after the deployment on 20 th Aug. Recommendation – Rescheduling of assessment for candidates who attempted assessment midway Assessment mode should not be amended in this scenario. Provide the candidate’s application date and the date on which rescheduling is made to A&I for confirmation of paper assignment and to recommend available assessment dates. In the event if the same paper cannot be assigned due to paper rotation schedule, the candidate will have to reattempt the newly assigned paper.

17398 • unknown • NaT • Issue has been escalated to Intelegain for the logs to verify that we are sending the correct information to SSG
17501 • unknown • NaT • Intelegain has figured the root cause. This is caused by the codes being implemented in UTC timing which is 8 hours later than us. When the candidate applied for the application, the RPT time slot was still 12am to 1159, thus CRM reflects the starting time to be 4pm the day before the actual assessment date. However, now with CR7 deployed and the RPT time slot has been amended to 9am, it will show the correct time slot and date of assessment

However, we are not able to validate that the assessment was terminated before the submission as there was no recording of her submitting the assessment. On top of that, the candidate has submitted an MC for 2nd August
17492 • unknown • NaT • A&I has verified that the candidate has attempted all the questions in the 2nd paper but was jumping around the questions.

17707 • unknown • NaT • DTO replied that we can see that she has failed her EA. May I clarify on the statement further “has passed her papers and EA but apparently it is not updated in Prometrics”? By “not updated”, do you mean that the EA score and outcome is not reflected correctly?
17708 • unknown • NaT • Cert team replied that She was from prometrics, there was a technical error, she was switched to Talview. Her assessment was done on Talview. The EA was cleared later on. I am asking Shanice if we can retrieve data from Talview on these. I have brought this case up to Ying hong and I remember looking at the information that showed the candidate have passed. So far I have not heard from Shanice. The candidate has completed her assessment however that data is missing. We need to find it.
17710 • unknown • NaT • DTO check with Rabiah what assistance do they require from our team and they replied that they need to locate the data. Once that is located, I need that to synch with prometrics and CRM.
17711 • unknown • NaT • DTO replied that we do not have the visibility to check the EA results taken in Talview platform and to approach A&I team for this action. Additionally, If you want to overwrite the EA results taken in Talview into Prometric, we need approval from Ying Hong from AI& team.
17714 • unknown • NaT • A&I replied that: We have checked on Talview and EA: She completed Talview competency assessments and passed She failed her self-EA. She had submitted her written EA, however a lot is missing in her submission and hence was recorded as Not Clear. Based on this, she would have failed due to EA fail. Suggestion is because the written EA was so sparse: Get her to complete the written EA again (attached original submission) Then we evaluate the overall status. If she fails at written submission, then her status is Failed, and it goes into the migrated list for transfer to Prometric If she clears, her status needs to be manually updated to OA passed on CRM, following the Talview flow. Her application on Prometric should be deleted in any case because her assessment was completed eventually on Talview flow.
17715 • unknown • NaT • Pending deletion of the candidate’s previous application
17888 • unknown • NaT • Candidate’s previous application has been removed in Prometric. Pending Cert team to cancel in CRM

17821 • unknown • NaT • DTO requested for the root cause from Prometric regarding the candidates' assessments being terminated, considering the fact that none of the paper setups include automatic suspension of assessments based on the UFM score .
17834 • unknown • NaT • brentmcdougall3147@gmail.com : Rachael reported that candidate had difficulty starting the assessment. DTO observed and validated that there were some issues during the assessment, including denied screen sharing, detected voices, and the candidate's face not being visible. Requested Ying Hong to review. Ying Hong suggested the assessment might have been terminated because the camera was closed, but there is no automatic suspension based on UFM score. DTO checked with Prometric whether the candidate’s response was saved and could resume from where he left off. Prometric confirmed that the candidate's responses were saved and he could continue the assessment after rescheduling. Eunice informed Rachael to proceed with rescheduling the assessment.
17835 • unknown • NaT • valerie@cadencehrconsulting.com : Rachael reported that candidate had difficulty with the assessment and wanted to check with DTO whether candidate is indeed she falls under the group of candidates with technical issues. DTO replied that candidate seemed to be unwell while taking to assessment, thus her sneezes and tissues used counted as UFM (Unfair Means) by the system. Nearing the end of the recording, she verbally said that she was going to the washroom, and after 1 minute, a pop up stating “Test exit due to exceeding the FNP (Face Not Present) count”. DTO shared our findings on the matter, where we would drop Prometric an email about this. ([POI-83 - Prometric] Test exit due to exceeding the FNP count) Rachael replied that for now, she will seek approval for reassessment waiver under technical issues for the candidate.
17844 • unknown • NaT • Prometric explained that the latest release included functionality that terminated the assessment if FNP UFM occurred continuously for 5 times, and agreed to remove this logic from the system as per earlier discussion in a meeting on 17/9. However this is incorrect as IHRP has not agreed to remove this logic from the system yet.
17845 • unknown • NaT • DTO replied to Prometric that, as discussed in the meeting on 17/9: Asked Prometric to respond to the email regarding the logic of automatic suspension. Clarified that the decision to remove or keep this logic is up to IHRP. DTO did not specify to Prometric that we will remove this logic form the system immediately. Currently asking Ying Hong to check and let DTO know if this feature should be removed.
17887 • unknown • NaT • Prometric has removed the automatic suspension feature in Production.
17936 • unknown • NaT • Closing this ticket here as fixes has been deployed to Production

18583 • unknown • NaT • Prometric has replied that the root cause was because the licenses count has went to 0. Prometric tech team was able to identify the issue immediately but because in IST it was not working hour and everyone was still asleep, no one was able to put in more licenses. Preventive Measures : Prometric team has just put in 100,000 licenses and given Rohit the access to add more licenses. On top of that, they have implemented a warning to let them know should the licenses count is too low.

This appears when the candidate does not have internet connectivity, and the popup appears with the Retry button. It will disappear when the candidate clicks on a Retry Button and if the internet is connected. Is the assessment terminated when there is an internet disruption? No System will not terminate, the popup will appear till the internet is not connected. If not, could you explain what might have happened during this candidate's attempt? All responses are saved in the backend until an internet connection is established. If a candidate exits from the secure browser by manually clicking the cross icon in the top right corner, they will not be able to restart the paper on the same day if their time slot has expired. However, if the time slot is still valid, the candidate can start the paper again on the same day. BU has reached out to the candidate to offer free rescheduling for candidate to resume assessment. We can close this case.

22016 • unknown • NaT • Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – Blue Screen in Secure Browser Issue Summary: Resource link was displaying a blue screen while clicking them. Initial investigation suggested that the issue was related to the internet bandwidth, but later investigation suggested a Java error. Root Cause: The secure browser relies on Java for execution, but a variable that should be cleared (or ""killed"") after use was persisting instead. This stale variable interfered with page rendering or authentication, leading to a failure in displaying content. Possible Causes: Memory Retention Issue – The Java application was not releasing or resetting the variable after a process completed. Session Handling Error – If the variable was linked to user sessions or authentication, it caused the browser to get stuck in an invalid state. Garbage Collection Delay – Java’s automatic memory cleanup (garbage collection) did not run at the expected time, leaving old data active. Variable Scope Issue – The variable was declared in a way that kept it alive beyond its intended use. Browser Rendering Conflict – If the stale variable was used in page rendering logic, it prevented proper loading, resulting in a blank or blue screen. Impact: The secure browser failed to load the resource links. Users were unable to access required content. Potential service disruption for users relying on this functionality. Immediate Workarounds: Cleared the cache and restarted the secure browser to check if it reset the variable. Checked for Java exceptions or errors in the logs to identify the exact point of failure. Reloaded the page in a different browser to confirm whether the issue was specific to the secure browser. Resolution & Fix Implementation: Our developers have implemented a logic fix to properly kill the old variable after its intended use. This prevents the variable from persisting and causing a blue screen. The fix has been pushed into the dev environment for testing. We will update the IHRP team by March 3 rd with

23969 • unknown • NaT • 10 April - The candidate's ability to continue the assessment after relaunching the browser further supports the theory of a temporary connectivity disruption rather than a persistent application issue.

21153 • unknown • NaT • Prometric confirmed that no one has used the 'Change Certification Category' function and issue is not due to this. Pending Prometric to perform the rectification first before we continue to investigate as candidate’s assessment is tomorrow (14/2/25).
21221 • unknown • NaT • Immediate Action Since candidate’s assessment was scheduled on 14/02/25, requested Prometric Team to: Remove the entire record and reinstate the IHRP-CA application with the correct CA paper assigned for 14/2/25 RPT assessment. Root Cause Separately, pending Prometric Team to revert on what is the candidate’s EC selection recorded in the logs. Based on our records in CRM, candidate has applied for an IHRP-CA certification, but the paper assigned in Prometric is IHRP-CP level.
21384 • unknown • NaT • According to the log the candidate has selected the CA type.

If the IHRP-CP level had been selected, the logs would have shown the selected values, as these are mandatory fields to proceed with the Eligibility Check. Since this case cannot be replicated and Prometric has confirmed that it was not manually modified, we will proceed to close the case for monitoring.

Check in CRM if candidate is certified, if no, please get Prometric to run the resync result API on their end for this candidate by today.

Eunice - Separately, eCert for this candidate has been generated in CRM and sent to the candidate. If there are no further issues, I propose to close this ticket, and we will follow up the result sync API issue separately with Prometric. @JunBin LIM and @Muhammad HASAN please validate if issue is related to by sharing the logs in CRM to Prometric and ask what is the response received.

24091 • unknown • NaT • 8 May: This issue occurred because the candidate in question belongs to an older data set. At that time, the system was misbehaving due to incorrect data being fed, especially when old or reused links were accessed by some candidates. As a result, this particular candidate is being affected due to legacy behavior. Explanation: This link was previously used by another candidate, and during that time the system entry was misbehaving. The current candidate is also from that same period. Kindly try creating a new candidate profile and replicate the case — if you still face the same issue, please let us know and we’ll investigate further. So far, this issue does not occur with newly created candidates, and the Upgrade navigation works as expected.
24134 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Closing the ticket with Ayush's confirmation that issue does not occur with newly created candidates. Additionally, issue happened to a test account in the UAT Env, data could be dirty while we have ongoing testing with different accounts. With that, we will close the ticket and monitor.

25006 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: New candidate reported that when she was trying to apply for a reassessment but was redirected to the assessment confirmation page showing the original assessment date. This mirrors the issue previously reported. In these instances, the candidate is simply using the link provided via the IHRP Portal, and no legacy links were used. Pending Prometric Team to relook at this case and revert. Email: margaret.ching@gmail.com
25151 • unknown • NaT • Hi Eunice, any update on the margaret.ching@gmail.com? Thank you.
25185 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rachael, Apologies for the delayed update - vendor has just gotten back. The vendor has attempted to investigate the issue and tried to apply from their end with a test data. During the check, they managed to apply successfully. They have removed the test data and this flow is now working as expected. Please inform the candidate to disregard any emails received and may proceed to reapply for Reassessment on her end. Do let us know if issue is resolved after.
25429 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Verified in Prometric and CRM that candidate has applied and paid for Reassessment. Closing this ticket.

24396 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Currently awaiting Prometric's reply, they have not been following up since 20th May. Apologies for the late follow-up. Thank you. @Shu Ting Ang FYI
24556 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Prometric has followed up with us and has recommended the following for the candidate to not face the same issue in future when taking assessment. 1. Ensure that no other application (e.g., MS Teams, Zoom, Skype, camera app) is using the camera in the background. 2. Allow all permissions when prompted by the Secure Browser (camera, microphone, screen). 3. Close any screen capture, recording, or remote desktop applications before starting the test. Avoid selecting specific windows — always choose entire screen during screen share prompt. We strongly advise informing candidates to perform these steps before test day and confirm settings if prompted again during the session. Thank you.
24560 • unknown • NaT • So would you categorize this as a technical issue? cos if it is a technical issue, then we would reschedule her free of charge. Thank you
24561 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, This is more of an advanced user issue. These instructions from Prometric were not clearly stated in the competency email. Hope this clarifies. Thank you.
24585 • unknown • NaT • Hi Hasan, As I understand from you yesterday, the issue is due to some apps running in the background when the candidate was doing her assessment. But this runs contrary to what we know is that when the secure browser is active, it ""kills"" all apps in the background. Please help to further confirm with L1 and Prometric as this could happen for future users. For this case, I will reschedule the student.
24746 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , currently as noted from the CRM, Shelby has not scheduled an assessment with her yet, we are still waiting for her to schedule, before we can mark this as resolved.

Candidates who have this issue and are unable to resolve the issue will be deemed as user issue. However, we noted that candidate has applied on 06/05, so this information was not conveyed to her. Regarding eHelp support - Prometric Team has confirmed that candidate did not reach out to them for support so we are unable to confirm if support was lacking as per what the candidate claimed. Hence, we are unable to confirm if this is a user or technical issue. However, given the extended turnaround time for the L2-level investigation and the absence of communication with the candidate, we recommend that the BU reschedule the session as a service recovery measure. Please also inform the candidate that the issue likely stemmed from the use of a VPN, and strongly advise using a personal laptop for the next attempt. If there are no further actions required from L2, please proceed to close this ticket. FYI @Muhammad Hasan

24297 • unknown • NaT • From: Ayush 🔍 Root Cause: The candidate had originally taken the test in the previous year . When the candidate applied for an upgrade or reassessment in the current year , an issue was triggered during the application process. This occurred because the system logic did not correctly handle scenarios where the year changes , resulting in an incorrect Repeater Status value. Due to this, the system assigned the wrong group to the candidate after submission, and when the candidate attempted to apply for an upgrade or reassessment, the system incorrectly displayed a “Test already attempted” message—despite the reassignment being valid. ✅ Fix: We have updated the logic to correctly validate reassignment and submission status in cross-year scenarios. This fix has been tested and verified successfully in the sandbox environment. 🧪 UAT Test Case Steps: Assign an EA or Full Paper to a candidate and have them complete the test in a previous year (e.g., 2024) to simulate a historical attempt. In 2025 , apply for an upgrade or reassessment for the same candidate. Verify that the correct test is assigned to the candidate. After submitting the new test, apply for another upgrade or reassessment to confirm the candidate can successfully reattempt, and the correct status and group are applied.

24532 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , this ticket has been deployed successfully on 29th May 2025.
24559 • unknown • NaT • 3 June - this ticket has been deployed successfully on 29th May 2025.
25311 • unknown • NaT • Background A candidate completed an assessment in 2024 and reapplied for a reassessment in 2025. During the second application in 2025, a system error occurred, incorrectly indicating that the candidate had already taken the assessment—even though they had not done so in the current year. System Logic Issues Identified Year Change Not Handled Properly The system didn’t correctly account for the fact that the candidate’s original test was taken in a different year. This caused a misinterpretation of the candidate’s Repeater Status—a value that determines the no. of assessments taken in a year. In this instance, the candidate’s repeater status was incorrectly carried over from the previous attempt, which led the system to mistakenly mark the new entry as already completed. Incorrect Group Assignment Because of the faulty Repeater Status, the system assigned the candidate to the wrong group after submission. This group assignment is crucial for determining the assessment paper to be taken. As candidate was assigned to a previous attempt's group, assessment is automatically deemed as taken. Error Message Pop-up When the candidate tried to do her assessment, the system showed a “Test already attempted” message. This message was triggered due to the above issues, where the system believed the candidate had already taken the test, even though the assessment was valid. Deployment Date 29/05/2025

24733 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, Please ask the candidate to add a new row of record to re-tabulate the HR experience and let us know if this resolves the issue. Please find the reply from the vendor for your reference: We investigated the issue and found that it occurs because all the experience records were created on the same day. There is a field called Total Experience, which is asynchronous and calculated by the system. When a new record is created, a plugin is triggered to update the Employment Last Update date. This update then triggers a contact flow that checks the Total Experience value. However, at that point, the system has not yet updated the Total Experience field, so its value is still 0. Since the calculation takes some time, this delay causes an incorrect value to be shown.

Do let me know the root cause and I will inform Kah Boon. While you are checking, I am waiting for Kah Boon to revert on the payment mode. Thanks
24359 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , you are right for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg . This seemed to be a manual creation, no payment found as well. I have logged a ticket with ITG for further analysis. For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com , by right, candidate should cancel the application in the front end portal in order to call the cancellation API which would simultaneously cancels the application in Prometric. In this case, Kah Boon has manually cancelled the application for the candidate via CRM which is why the application still exists in Prometric. If this application has been confirmed to be cancelled, you may reach out to prometric directly to remove the application in Production. However, it is important to advise BUs to let the candidate cancel the application on their own else, there would be manual intervention like this case.
24361 • unknown • NaT • Ticket has been raised in DC3P under 580.
24365 • unknown • NaT • Hi Kah Boon, For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, for cases if candidate has active applications with "" Assessment scheduled "" in Prometric, it is advisable to get candidate to cancel at their end and apply a new application. Manual intervention on creation of application will cause this issue. May we confirm if you would like to proceed with the cancellation of assessment in Prometric before we raised a request to prometric. As for lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg and leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg, L2 is currently investigating with vendor on this.
24470 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rabiah, As discussed earlier for the items: 1. To remove the draft under kairi.nomeru@gmail.com for candidate to reapply. 6. To remove the draft under wendy_yoong@yahoo.com then assist to update candidate email to kohseehwa77@hotmail.com. 7. To remove the paid assessment in Prometric due to wrong selection. Thank you.
24482 • unknown • NaT • Hi I need to delete application in prometrics for 3 kohseehwa77@hotmail.com. she is supposed to take EA but I keyed wrongly. Thankyou
24523 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , The issue has been identified for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg . Root cause: A required field in the user profile was left empty (residential status). As a result, although the application was successfully created in Prometric via the CreatePrometricManualApplication API , an error occurred in CRM. This caused the application to remain in draft status despite the API call being successful. Next steps: We are currently working with Intelegain to explore potential fixes. Please see the proposed rectification plan below: Once the respective BUs confirm the impacted candidates, please let us know so that we can have intelegain trigger the API via postman to update the application status.
24526 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rabiah, As discussed. There is no action on our end for item 3. For items below we have: 1. Draft removed for kairi.nomeru@gmail.com 6. Draft removed for wendy_yoong@yahoo.com 7. Draft removed for Tan_Ying_Tong@Psd.Gov.Sg
24569 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rabiah and Kah Boon, The issue has been identified for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg. Root cause: A required field in the user profile was left empty (residential status). As a result, although the application was successfully created in Prometric but not in CRM which caused the application to remain in draft status. May we confirm that these 2 candidates will be taking assessment on 09 June 2025 and there are no more other candidates impacted? Thank you.
24586 • unknown • NaT • Hi Cheryl, yes, both Xin Hwei and Lisa are taking the remote assessment on 9 Jun 2025. You may also like to note that 20250500111 and 20250500098 are still reflected as draft in CRM but application has been created in Prometric. For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, her appln has been created in Prometric but not reflected in CRM
24796 • unknown • NaT • Hi Kah Boon, may we confirm if both leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg is Singaporean, PR or Foreigner for us to proceed backend? For candidate kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, it is reflected as Draft in Prometric and OA Failed in CRM.
24801 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, @Cheryl As discussed with Kah Boon, we’ve conducted an investigation into the two candidates whose assessments are scheduled in Prometric but are still showing as drafts in CRM. Among them, only leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg has not attempted the assessment, and this application remains in draft status. This aligns with the root cause analysis provided by Joy. Next Step: As of 10 June, Kah Boon has confirmed that the only impacted candidate is leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg. @Joycelyn Goh Kindly review and proceed to have Intelegain trigger the API via Postman to update the application status accordingly. Thank you.
24821 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , could you confirm if lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg is a singaporean?

As for the candidate's attempt, we are confirming the below points with the vendor so you can update the candidate on how to proceed from this. 1. How should the candidate resume the EA assessment? Can she use the same link in the competency assessment details email? 2. Are her answers from the attempt saved in the system or candidate has to reattempt from the beginning? FYI @Muhammad Hasan
24915 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi Rachael and @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor's current recommendation as per the questions mentioned by @Eunice Chiang below are: 1. Question: How should the candidate resume the EA assessment? Can she use the same link in the competency assessment details email? Vendor’s Answer: Yes , the candidate can use the same link from the Competency Assessment Details email to resume the EA assessment. 2. Question: Are her answers from the attempt saved in the system or candidate has to reattempt from the beginning? Vendor’s Answer: The assessment will resume from the last saved progress . Do let us know if you require further clarification on this issue.
24996 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Candidate has feedback on the bottom: Upon clicking the same link to enter the EA exam, I am unable to click on the ""Start Assessment"" button. Nothing happened and it's not loading at all. Please check in with Prometric and provide a solution by end of today thank you.
25020 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25082 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting, We are still currently awaiting a follow-up from Prometric by 20th June EOD.
25117 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Since candidate is unable to proceed with the existing EA link from the previous competency email, we have requested Prometric Team on the following: 1. We’re attempting to regenerate the email to the candidate so she can retry accessing the EA link. However, I noticed there isn’t an option to resend the competency email. Pending their advice on this. 2. Pending Prometric Team to confirm whether their team has logs of the candidate’s EA attempt, particularly the instance where she attempted but did not submit as per their investigation. 3. Lastly, if this issue cannot be resolved, we have requested their team to help remove the current EA entry so the candidate can reattempt her EA. We will keep you updated again.
25179 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has removed the existing EA entry for the candidate. She can now try to take the exam again. Do advise to use the old EA Link for her to attempt the EA again. Please let us know if you require further assistance, and follow up if further issues arise. Thank you.
25193 • unknown • NaT • Shu Ting: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the information. @Rachael, we have replied to the candidate and will be closing this ticket thank you.
25609 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Candidate wrote in on 2 July to inform us that she has issues with the attempt of the experience assessment. She has two records: one sent on 26 February 2024, and another triggered on 25 October 2024 for a “complimentary reassessment of the Experience Assessment.” As noted in the screenshot shared in my previous email, the 25 October 2024 link shows no record. She is checking if she should proceed with the link sent on 26 February 2024? Please reach out to Prometric urgently as this issues has been pending since May thank you.
25641 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has reverted to us and let us know that the candidate can try now—it’s working. The issue occurred due to a configuration error when we handled this candidate’s data from the backend. This has been resolved. Let me if any further issues arise. Thank you.
25642 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the updates. We will close this ticket once the candidate has completed the Experience Assessment thank you.
26149 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan and @Eunice Chiang , The candidate revert yesterday with the same no record found issue, please look into it urgently. Candidate would like to request for a link since she has faced repeating issues with the old one. Thank you.
26268 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We were given two options to: 1. Remove the draft application from the backend, and the specialization does NOT change. 2. Remove the entire entry if the candidate wants to change the specialization. We have selected the first one as of now, and Prometric will verify and let us know on this asap, before we can proceed to the candidate. After verification from them, you may ask the candidate if she wants to change her specialization from ""Compensation Benefits/Total Rewards"". We will revert here once verification is completed. Thank you!.
26334 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has verified that upon clicking the previous link it will work. You may proceed to ask the candidate if she would like to change her specialization or stick with her current one, which is ""Compensation Benefits/Total Rewards"", which she previously selected. If she would like to change her specialization, please revert to us again as we need approval from BUs to remove the entry. Otherwise, if not, she may proceed to retry. If the issue still does not work, you may proceed to escalate to us again. Thank you.
26354 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information, we will follow up with the candidate before reverting.
26394 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , The candidate would like to change the specialization please check in with A&I for approval and escalate this thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang

26444 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rachael and @Shu Ting Ang , To recap, to proceed with changing the EA specialisation, we will need to cancel the current application and submit a new one. The following steps are required: 1. Remove the application in Prometric 2. Deactivate the Reassessment application in CRM (application no. 20240200385_1) 3. No payment transfer is needed, as there is no payment made for the reassessment (confirmed by Finance Team) 4. BU to recreate the Reassessment application in Prometric using CR 4 Please note that point 1 is completed. May I request BU to proceed with step 2 onwards and leave a remark for this action. Feel free to reach out if assistance is required.

27700 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, thanks. I will inform the candidate to retry accordingly.
27927 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, providing you an update that candidate managed to complete her reassessment of EA and passed. She is certified on 11/08/2025. This case can be closed at L1 end.
27952 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Cheryl, Thanks for the update! We will get vendor to provide an update on what was done differently this time that the candidate was able to proceed. We need to ensure that the steps taken to rectify such cases are properly documented so we can respond swiftly to such cases in future. Thereafter, i will close the ticket here.
28257 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Vendor has confirmed that issue reoccurred because candidate re-clicked the EA link before entry was being removed by the vendor, which created a new record. After removing the new entry, the candidate was able to proceed and complete the EA. With that, we can proceed to close this case.

24812 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: HI @Shu Ting Ang , Please note that this is a technical issue , stands from the lack of optimization capabilities to handle voice events detected during assessment. Please proceed to work with BU to reschedule for the candidate and recommend candidate to do her/his assessment in a room with no loud background noises if possible. Root cause: The vendor has completed a detailed review of the logs and observed that the Voice Detection (VD) events for this candidate were triggered very frequently. We are currently validating the case further, as such a high volume of VD triggers is leading to performance degradation, particularly on the candidate’s side, resulting in potential memory issues. In this candidate’s case, the unusually high frequency of VD triggers appears to have caused memory strain, which likely led to the screen freezing during submission. Regarding the two proposed solutions: Optimizing VD Handling Pros: Improves overall efficiency without limiting detection functionality; ensures smoother experience across all candidates. Cons: May require more development and testing time to roll out safely across environments. Effort: Medium to High – involves changes to detection logic and performance benchmarking. Introducing a Trigger Threshold Pros: Quick to implement; effectively prevents system overload in edge cases. Cons: May reduce the granularity of monitoring beyond the defined threshold; needs careful calibration. Effort: Low to Medium – a configuration-level update with defined impact boundaries. We are still working closely with the vendor to resolve the issue and will keep L1 posted once issue has been resolved. FYI @Muhammad Hasan please note on this.
24928 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Alisha Shaikh @Muhammad Hasan Please follow up as Eunice has communicated. Include a note after you have reach out to BU and the date for the fix.

24414 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Based on your description, the candidate would not be able to cancel her CA assessment scheduled for 19 March, even though she wrote in 17 March. As per policy, cancellation should be made no later than ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled assessment date or start date of remote assessment window This would therefore be considered a no-show application. If the candidate intends to apply for the IHRP-CP, she will first need to settle the outstanding SFC claim of $272.50. Once payment is received, we can proceed to cancel the application in Prometric and initiate the cancellation of the paid application to allow her to reapply. We hope this clarifies the situation. Please let us know if any further action is required on our end. Thank you.

24856 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, please find my response below. Candidate Journey This candidate was part of the previous 2022 assessment flow for CP, which followed the OA-then-EA sequence. She successfully passed the OA but did not pass the EA. As a result, she was bumped down from CP to CA. As the candidate now wishes to reattempt CP, she may proceed accordingly (refer to CR 2025-001). Kindly request the BUs to deactivate application 20220900095. Once the candidate has reapplied, the BUs should reactivate 20220900095 and include an internal note in the application.

24568 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Following up on the candidate’s case, I’ve consulted with the L2 team and confirmed that the issue stems from an incorrect selection made during the application process. As a result, the candidate is not eligible for exemption at this stage. To proceed correctly, the candidate should select “IHRP Recognised Qualification” under the “Other” category and indicate the relevant institution to qualify for exemption from the EA. Kindly advise the candidate to cancel the current application and reapply with the appropriate selection. Additionally, as discussed with both Kah Boon and Rabiah, please note that on-site assessments are not available for exemption assessments. Should the candidate wish to reapply, the remote assessment option must be selected. Thank you for your assistance.

24786 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang Please refer to the screenshot from finance: Hi DTO Team, Could you please help confirm whether this application was cancelled by the candidate himself on 16/05/2025, as reflected in the audit history? This seems unusual as the assessment date was 14/05/2025, and our understanding is that the system should not allow candidates to cancel their applications after the assessment date. Additionally, based on the attached email from the company, candidate stated that he did not initiate the cancellation request, yet the assessment was cancelled. Appreciate your urgent clarification on what actually happened please, as this may affect the billing. Thank you.
24829 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Your understanding is aligned with us. We have raised this ticket to the vendor logged under . We will work closely with the vendor and keep you updated again.
24917 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang We have concluded the investigation confirmed that the cancellation was initiated by the Candidate from the IHRP Portal. As to why candidate was able to do so, the vendor discovered that when the dashboard landing page is loading, the 'Cancel' button will lit up as the JavaScript in place takes a few moments to disable the cancel button. During this delay, if the user clicks the cancel button, the application gets cancelled. To avoid this issue and ensure a smoother user experience, we need to update the logic so that the cancel button is either hidden or disabled immediately upon page load.

24849 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: We are currently awaiting a follow-up from Prometric. This case could be closely related to , a ticket that already has been deployed on 29th May 2025. FYI @shu ting.
24933 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Please send a chaser to follow up with Prometric thank you.
25033 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Shu Ting and Hasan, We had a call with the vendor earlier, here is a summary of the key points discussed and the actions pending from vendor: 1. The candidate claims that he has not attempted the Reassessment (EA Component only), stating that the email containing the access link was not received. As confirmed during our discussion, this was due to a technical issue, as explained by Prometric. 2. However, both the masterlist report and the EA detailed report show a completed EA score and recorded responses. Based on our conversation, this record is likely from the candidate’s initial assessment, suggesting that the EA was attempted twice in February 2025. Pending vendor to confirm whether this scenario is accurate based on their investigation and system logs. 3. If the above is verified, vendor will advise whether the following actions are feasible: a. Remove the entire Reassessment entry and have IHRP create a new reassessment application for the candidate. b. Remove only the EA record, allowing the candidate to reattempt the Reassessment EA. Requested Prometric Team to get back by 18/6 EOD as candidate is pending a reply from IHRP.
25096 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , May I check if there is any follow up from the vendor?
25118 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has reverted yesterday and confirmed that candidate did attempt EA twice on two occasions. However, since both records likely equates to a 'Pass' mark, we will need to confirm with Prometric if these two attempts are considered as one. If that is the case, we need to route the case to Sachrit for his approval to remove the 2nd EA record on the basis of: 1. Candidate attempted EA twice using the same link, once in Feb and once in Mar - which is not allowed. 2. Candidate did not complete EA in one sitting as per instructions. Decision will be on A&I for the candidate's next steps. We will update on this again.
25180 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Sachrit has followed up and mentioned that it is okay to remove the second entry for the candidate. We are currently waiting for Prometric to remove the entry so that the candidate can perform his reassessment for EA. We will keep you updated on this.
25347 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Any updates on the above?
25377 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Still awaiting a reply from Prometric, I have already sent a chaser yesterday.
25412 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have already sent out an email to the candidate, whereby Prometric has already removed the entry for the candidate to attempt the EA. We will wait for the candidate to revert back if there are any issues. If there are no issues, we can close this ticket.
25443 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Candidate has feedback that no record was found upon clicking the original link for EA. I have sent a chaser to Prometric for them further investigate this issue. Please refer to Jira for screenshots.
25510 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The candidate has managed to attempt the EA after fixing a mapping issue was resolved from the vendor's end. You may proceed to close this ticket.
25575 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information. We will close the ticket.

24934 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Alisha Shaikh , Please follow up on this case with @Muhammad Hasan . Based on verification with Eunice, the current reassessment application was manually created by the Certification Team—most likely by Shelby—which is why the assessment appears in Prometric. Kindly inform the candidate that we are currently investigating the matter and will escalate it to the cert team to determine the appropriate next steps, given that the candidate no longer wishes to proceed with the IHRP-SP reassessment. End off with please let us know if you require any support in removing the scheduled reassessment application from Prometric. Thank you.

24935 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Kindly request a screenshot from the candidate before escalating the case to Prometric for investigation. Thank you.
25022 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25080 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , For this candidate, it is advised to: 1. Ensure that when the screen sharing prompt appears, they select the ""Entire Screen"" option and then click ""Share"". 2. For Mac users, verify that screen recording access is enabled for the Secure Browser. 3. Close any applications that might conflict with screen sharing (e.g., MS Teams, Zoom). 4. Use a single monitor setup if possible, or select the primary screen if using dual monitors. 5. Restart the system before launching the Secure Browser again. We are currently awaiting for an e-help transcript from Piyush.
25088 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , I have reviewed the ehelp transcript and concluded that this is a user issue. Please note that MAC devices typically requires additional step for the set up, and the candidate do not know how to allow such permissions on his/her personal device. The ehelp agent has also advised to look for Screen Sharing permissions on device (though not explicit). This is the possible step that candidate should have done: macOS Screen Recording Permission (For Mac users): -Even in Secure Browser mode, macOS requires manual screen recording permission to be granted under: -System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Screen Recording -Without this, screen sharing cannot proceed—even if the user selects a screen. Please note on this and prompt if BU would like to add this information onto the ehelp documentation page for candidate to prepare for the assessment. If there are no further queries, please proceed to close the case and route to BU for follow up. FYI @Shu Ting Ang - if its a case to route to BU, please confirm if Hasan should hand this over to your team.
25099 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. Hi @Muhammad Hasan , We will be following up on this case.

25021 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang and Rachael, Vendors have investigated and confirmed that there is no issues with the use of this promo code. Suspect that this was due to cache and connectivity issue at the point when candidate accessed this. We have verified this in Production and confirmed that promo code is usable (see attached SS). Hence, we suggest that future candidates who faced this issue to perform a hard reload with the steps below and this should resolve the issue. 1. Launch F12/Inspect Tool 2. Right click on the 'Refresh' button in the top ribbon 3. Select 'Empty cache and hard reload' I noted that manual reassessment applications has been created for the candidate, in that case, please close the case for monitoring.
25098 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the information, we will close the case for monitoring.
26424 • unknown • NaT • Another candidate unable to use the promo code despite doing 1. Launch F12/Inspect Tool 2. Right click on the 'Refresh' button in the top ribbon 3. Select 'Empty cache and hard reload' Gerald Wu <gerald.wu@gmail.com>
26439 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rachael, Could you kindly provide the screenshot for us to investigate thank you. Hi @Eunice Chiang , Candidate is unable to use the promo code, please let us know if you require more information from the candidate thank you.
26458 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi All, I have verified that the promo code is still functioning as expected in Production. Hi Rachael, as spoken, I suggest to get candidate to retry - and issue could be either he did not wait for price summary to load, or it is due to the same connection and cache issue described below. As such, we will suggest removing draft and retry from the start. @Shu Ting Ang - we will request Prometric to remove draft and update again. Please note that no action is required for Reassessment draft (i dont see any draft record in CRM). @Muhammad Hasan please assist to request prometric to remove draft for gerald.wu@gmail.com .
26470 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Eunice Chiang , I have sent out an email to Prometric to assist in deleting the draft application. Will revert back as soon as they reply. Thank you. FYI @Shu Ting Ang

26717 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have raised this to the vendor and will update again once we have any findings. I will provide an update by tomorrow.
26748 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We will be adding the impacted candidate to the list here.
26752 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Can you confirm that both gerald.wu@gmail.com and moonling9009@yahoo.com is facing this issue?
26763 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have confirmed with the vendor and also tested on our end that there are no issues with the Promo Code API and the usability of this API. In that case, we would like to request for a call together with our vendor and the candidate to troubleshoot this. May i suggest to hop on a call with Gerald to validate first? Please let us know candidate preferred time, and preferably in the noon so the vendor can accommodate easily.
26799 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We will follow up with the candidate regarding the pending matter. Additionally, please note that the second candidate, Loh Mun Ling, has submitted the application without applying the promo code. Thank you.
27004 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , We have reached out to the candidate, pending the confirmation from the candidate and I have bcc you loop cheryl in thank you.
27458 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , Following up from the call with the candidate, the vendor has confirmed that the root cause is likely due to the missing 'Assessment Schedule Date' field which was identified to be 'null' during the call. Due to the missing field, the API was unable to be called. As such, we have added the talview assessment date onto this field. After candidate has successfully applied for reassessment, this field will be overwritten accordingly. Please advice candidate to retry with the promo code and let us know if issue persists.
27579 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, Candidate: gerald.wu@gmail.com Draft has been deleted and we have inform candidate to try to apply again. I have also informed him to update us once he has successfully applied or still encountering any issues. Will follow up on this. Thank you
27805 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, candidate has informed that he is able to use the promo code for his reassessment application. All good for now!
27820 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , noted on that. It seems like this issue only occurs for Talview candidates who were migrated and are trying to use the promo code. In that case, we may have to configure the system logic to accomodate that. However, it seems like there are only 2 candidates with this issue so far, so we will plan this change and work on it in accordance to the priority list. In the meantime, we can proceed to close the ticket as moonling9009@yahoo.com has applied without the promo code. FYI @Joycelyn Goh , @Zac Tan @Muhammad Hasan - please note on this issue. Promo code is not usable for Migrated Talview candidates with 'Assessment schedule date' field empty. Refer to linked DC3P ticket for more info.
28086 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice, Adding to list for the impacted candidate with the same issues when using the promo code.

24924 • unknown • NaT • ST: Need to change current status to submitted.
25004 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We found out that the candidate has faced an issue whereby they could not proceed past the microphone check. In the logs it was stated that the microphone could not be started because it is in use by another application, or the right permissions have not been set. You may refer to the screenshot: Here is what we are confirming with the vendor: If the issue could be similar to thread: E-Help Agent unavailable when candidate reached out - mtlee006@suss.edu.sg. - since the microphone is stated to be in use by another application. Letting us know if the candidate reached out to e-help. Once we receive a reply, I will follow up accordingly. FYI @Joycelyn Goh , @Eunice Chiang .
25023 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25081 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has advised that: Close all other applications that might be using the microphone. Ensure microphone access is enabled for both the operating system and the secure browser. Confirm that the microphone volume is not muted or set to zero. Restart the system before launching the test to release any mic locks from other applications. We are currently awaiting an e-help transcript from Prometric.
25087 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have received the ehelp transcript and here are our findings: 1. Candidate claimed that she has to do EA in her competency assessment details email. However, based on her application details, she is exempted from EA. We have also validated this in Production - EA will not be assigned if user selected 'CSC HR Foundation Programme' during EC. 2. Candidate seemed to be unclear with how to proceed with assessment. Advice candidate to use personal device and IHRP registered email for assessment. 3. Misinformation regarding the need to attempt EA from Agniv (ehelp support agent) will be escalated and addressed to Prometric Team. Separately, based on the transcript, it appears the candidate is experiencing difficulty starting her assessment, as she mentioned needing to complete the EA beforehand. However, according to her application details, she is exempt from the EA requirement. Additionally, we’ve observed that she was able to initiate the environment and system check – which is why she had issues with her microphone (tracked in logs). We will confirm with Prometric Team if this understanding is aligned and update again.
25101 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information, we will wait for Prometric to revert.
25184 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has responded and confirmed the following points: 1. The candidate initially received the competency assessment details via her Outlook work email in May. She later forwarded the email to her Gmail account in June, prior to the assessment. During this forwarding process, due to differences in how email clients render HTML, some content was corrupted—resulting in the EA Link appearing in the Gmail version. According to the vendor, this is not a technical issue but rather a limitation outside our control. That said, the vendor will explore whether such scenarios can be programmatically addressed. 2. The original email (without the EA link) is the correct version, and the candidate should have been aware of her assessment components. 3. The eHelp agents responded based on the issue the candidate repeatedly raised—namely, that the ""EA Link is not working""—and thus their troubleshooting was focused accordingly. 4. Despite these issues, the candidate successfully accessed the secure browser (as the EA was not required and the paper assignment was accurate), but was ultimately unable to proceed due to a microphone issue. Given the above, I recommend that the BU consider supporting her reschedule request, as the confusion stemmed from the email forwarding. We will follow up regarding the HTML rendering during email forwarding (if its feasible) else we update again to close the ticket for monitoring. Original (Outlook) - sent from Prometric Forwarded to Gmail - from Outlook
25195 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information, we will inform cert team to reschedule her assessment due to all the leading issues. Please let us if there is any update upon following up on the HTML rendering during email forwarding so that we can close the ticket for monitoring thank you.
25427 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has responded that they will try to get back by 4th July. However, based on the situation, this could be a CR. Hence, propose to keep this ticket closed for monitoring and note this as an internal note that forwarded emails from different email client may have HTML rendering issues, and EA section may be corrupted in that way. Though it may not happen in all cases (did not happen to me in when I tried to replicate Outlook>Gmail), as such issues is not within Prometric Team's control at the moment.
25431 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice, Thank you for the information. We will close this ticket for monitoring.
26137 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we have closed this ticket on our end for monitoring, as there is no resolution to this, since the issue is beyond our control. I have already sent out an email to L1s to identify the issue under the thread: Candidates face Email rendering issues when forwarded - . You may refer to that if you face emails like these. The screenshots of an example of unrendered email will be attached in Jira again for your reference. Thank you.

25089 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Zac Tan , Please attempt to look into this issue.
25114 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have checked with the vendor and conclude this is a ""User Issue"". The secure browser is working fine, and other candidates had no issues. The candidate likely blocked camera/mic permissions or had device issues such as disconnected hardware, privacy settings, antivirus interference, or other apps (like MsTeams) using the devices. If they used an external webcam or mic, it must be connected, up to date drivers recognised by the OS and working before launching the secure browser. Recommended next steps: Ask the candidate to check device connection and permissions, ensure privacy settings allow camera/mic use for all apps, try using a different device or user account, verify no other apps are using the webcam/mic, and restart the computer with devices reconnected before launching the secure browser.

25213 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , This candidate has been added into the impact list in . I have reached out to e-help, and they have come back with the following: 1. Ask the candidate to connect to a home or personal internet network, avoiding office/corporate/VPN-secured connections. 2. Ensure VPN is completely disabled. 3. Restart the system and relaunch Secure Browser after switching networks. For Windows: 1. Check if Windows Defender Firewall or any third-party antivirus (like McAfee, Norton, etc.) is blocking the Secure Browser. Add an exception for the application. 2. Disable VPN or proxy settings from Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy. 3. Avoid public or office Wi-Fi networks. You may refer to the screenshots in Jira for the e-help transcript.
25220 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the discussion, please check in with Prometric whether the solution was given to the candidate and any follow up by end of today thank you.
25245 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , here is the root cause and solutions for the issue Root Cause: Candidate faced issues with accessing the Secure Browser because she had a VPN. With a LAN Port or VPN running the background, candidates will be unable to proceed into the Secure Browser. Solution: This current ticket is related to , where a sub-line was added: “ Please ensure you are not connected via a LAN or VPN "", and where VPN network access was blocked. These two tickets have already been deployed on 25th June 2025, and 29th May 2025 respectively. Next Steps: Please navigate to the BUs to see if they feel that this issue is eligible for rescheduling since we already have deployed the tickets as resolutions for past issues similar to this. Thank you.
25345 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the information. We will route this case to the certification team for review.
25410 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Referring to the response provided by agent Agniv K, which stated that candidates can reschedule their assessments, we’ve since received multiple complaints—particularly in cases where candidates are asked to cover the rescheduling fee. To prevent any miscommunication to the candidates, we have formally requested Prometric team to adopt this new process and standard reply. For any candidate enquiries related to assessment rescheduling or matters beyond the Prometric Team’s scope, the following standard response will be used: “For escalation of matters relating to assessment, please reach out to hello@ihrp.sg for further assistance.” Confirmed with L1 on wording.

25218 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , The candidate followed up via ticket #98808, confirming that she received the access code I regenerated earlier this morning. However, the email indicates that she is required to complete the Experience Assessment. As she has already passed the Experience Assessment during her initial upgrade to the IHRP-CP application, could we kindly check with Prometric on why the EA link was triggered again? Thank you.
25378 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Here's what we're checking with Prometric: 1. Firstly, they will let us know the root cause of the issue of why the assessment details was sent to the wrong email address, whether this issue could be similar to . 2. Secondly, let us know why she was assigned EA in the email although she initially had passed already. a. I am assuming it is because of the wrong email address, if not, let us know. 3. Thirdly, please provide whether the competency assessment details were initially delivered.

25645 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Any updates on the above?
25646 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have proceeded to close this ticket and will send out an email to let L1s know how to revert to candidates when they face issues like these. Here is what we found and the solutions we will do: Context: Recently, a few candidates have encountered issues where the EA link appears in forwarded emails, even though they were not assigned EA. This discrepancy is due to how emails are rendered when forwarded. Identified Problem: Candidates may have configured email forwarding in various ways: When an email is sent to the candidate , it involves forwarding to multiple clients (e.g., Outlook and Gmail simultaneously from the candidate's end) Setting up email forwarding within the same email client Any direct forwarding of emails to any other email As a result, the competency email may display the EA link in the forwarded version, but not in the original. Next Steps: As confirmed by the vendor, this issue is not within our control, and the vendor is still exploring ways to manage such scenarios. In the meantime, please follow these steps: Ask the candidate to provide a screenshot of the competency email sent to them (must include to and from — highlighted in yellow). Verify the recipient’s email address using the screenshot, and check for any mismatch in CRM and Prometric. Check Prometric to confirm EA assignment status: ✅ If EA is assigned and the forwarded email contains the EA link → No action needed. ❌ If EA is not assigned but the forwarded email contains the EA link → Inform candidate to refer to the original email sent from donotreply@assessment.prometric.com OR refer to the version sent to the IHRP registered email address. IF emails are not delivered, you may request the L2 to ask for the delivery status of the competency email. If you need further clarification, feel free to reach out. Thank you.
25647 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , May I check in on the 3 point that you are checking with Prometric? 3. Thirdly, please provide whether the competency assessment details were initially delivered. Appreciate if you can revert by today as it is pending for sometime thank you.
25651 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Apologies for not attaching the candidate's screenshots, but you may refer to the screenshots attached in Jira. The initial email that was sent out was blocked as noticed by the handle: courts-com-sg.mail.protection.outlook.com, hence the candidate could not receive competency details. The EA Link is present due to a rendering issue as mentioned below, due to the forwarding of emails. You may let her know that she can ignore the link because in our system, she is not assigned EA, since she already initially passed. Hope this clarifies! Thank you.

25379 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Ticket deployed on 26/6/25 Production testing results attached in Jira. Issue to be monitored: The PDF within the expandable file can be downloaded and saved locally. However, this is not a showstopper, as the candidate is accessing materials from an external site and will not be able to retrieve this source within the secure browser. Additionally, the candidate should still have access to all resources available on the site. Vendor (Ayush) has confirmed that this occurred because the ‘Save As’ window was permitted to prevent the screen from freezing in Secure Browser. As a result, restricting the download functionality is not feasible in this case, since Secure Browser cannot override the default PDF viewing behavior.

25433 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joycelyn Goh Vidhya spotted the recertification application below 20250300300 as the status is draft, but payment has been made (STRIPE screenshot below) in Mar 2025. For this case, as the status is draft, the application has not been reviewed, and the latest e-certificate has not been sent. Kindly advise thank you.
25435 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, this is seems to be a separate issue. A new ticket has been logged with the vendor.

25668 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh , May I check if there is any update on this?
25671 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, our vendor has completed their analysis. Findings We have attempted to replicate the scenario from our end but were unable to reproduce the issue. Additionally, we reviewed the system logs, Power Automate flows, and API calls. From our analysis, it is likely that either: 1. The user had already submitted the application before clicking the button again, or 2. There was a temporary network glitch that caused the action to be processed incorrectly It is likely that (2) there was a glitch in the power automate flow due to the time period when the status was reverted. As this appears to be an isolated case, we recommend monitoring the situation in production. With BUs confirmation, we will proceed to manually rectify the application status from ""Draft"" to ""Submitted"". Please let me know before i proceed.
25679 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joy, Thank you for the information. Please allow me to check in with Kah Boon. Hi Kah Boon, Please find the findings below and the possible cause, kindly confirm if we can proceed to manually rectify the application status from ""Draft"" to ""Submitted""? Thank you.

26040 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Rachael, We’ve looked into the issue where a candidate’s reassessment application is showing up in Prometric, but not in the CRM system. Also, it looks like their payment didn’t go through in Stripe, even though the logs show the process was marked as successful. We’re currently investigating this with the vendors to understand how the candidate was approved and had a slot created without a completed payment. For now, we’re waiting on the vendors to look into it further. Once they confirm whether it’s a technical issue or a user-related one, we’ll let you know the next steps to rectify it. Thank you.

25662 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Name: Lim Cyril Email: cyril.lim@tenderfresh.com.sg Current status: CRM-OA Failed (HR Competency Paper - 0 marks) This candidate faces some issues during his assessment on 1 July. Additionally, the candidate has requested to expedite the process and reschedule their assessment. They have a very tight schedule and are only available on 9 July or 1 August. While the first issue may be related to the user's hardware, the second appears to be a technical error that has previously occurred when papers were submitted before completion. Please find the full information in Jira. Do let us know if you require any additional clarification or screenshots that are missing. Please look into this case urgently thank you. From candidate: Hi Shelby and Vidhya, As spoken at IHRP office earlier today at around 12.40pm, as requested, kindly find below the details of the issues I faced. I have attached the various emails I received and the email thread with the both of you. Issue with screen sharing at 9.00am After keying in the access code into the IHRP secure browser on my MacBook Air, I tried clicking onto the screen share button below since 9.00am but to no avail. My MacBook Air's technical configurations meets all the requirements and I allowed access to all location, camera, microphone, screen permissions, etc. I searched https://ehelp.prometric.com/ihrp/s/ but found that the link does not help me with the issue I face. The chat was also offline. I tried to contact IHRP but no contact number was provided. Attempting the Labour Legislation Paper close to 10.00am It was only around close to 10.00am that I managed to attempt the labour legislation paper after I tried to look for other computers and managed to get 1 working. Even so, I cleared the system check on the other computer but when I was at the environment and security check, I waited for around 5-10 mins on the screen below before proctor 4 logged in and viewed my surrounding to allow me to attempt
25708 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we have noticed that the candidate faced a few issues: 1. During the optional break, the test was automatically submitted even though the candidate did not touch anything. 2. The candidate initially faced screen sharing issues with the Mac but was able to proceed after using a different laptop. This case is related to , so we will not need to investigate that. 3. E-Help was offline initially when the candidate tried to reach out between 9-10am. However, she was able to contact an agent in the afternoon. Here's what we're checking with Prometric: 1. Why the HR Paper was automatically submitted during the optional break, which caused the candidate to fail the HR Paper without attempting it and did not manage to finish the optional break. 2. Why E-Help was offline initially, and providing us an e-help transcript. In the meantime, please proceed to waiver the reassessment for the candidate since he faced a major technical issue which we will need to investigate. Do reach out if you have any further clarifications or assistance needed. Thank you.
25745 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @ Hasan, Thank you for the information, we will inform the BU to proceed with proceed to waiver the reassessment for the candidate since he faced a major technical issue which we will need to investigate.

26699 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent to vendor.
26730 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently the identified root cause was that the candidate submitted the test at exactly zero seconds remaining, causing a double submission that led to unexpected behavior in the system, including submission status inconsistencies and candidate confusion. However, we suspected that this issue could be related to . We are confirming if: 1. Is this candidate facing the issue faced in 2. The candidate is facing a different issue because the candidate really did submit the paper as the timer runs out, causing double submissions as the test is also automatically submitted by the system. We will revert with our findings as soon as they get back to us. Thank you.
27005 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Hasan, Any updates on the above? Thank you.
27017 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The issue faced by the candidate was indeed related to , but since the candidate submitted the test at exactly zero seconds remaining, it is slightly different. Please take note that this indeed a technical issue faced by the candidate, since it was a double submission. You may advise that the candidate should not submit the test at exactly zero seconds. They have made a fix such that if a similar case occurs, it as such that only a single submission goes through. Feel free to reach out if you need further clariifcations. Thank you.

No response from candidate till today 4 July. Please refer to the attached screenshot and check with Prometric to confirm whether the candidate has reached out and to investigate the issue further. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh
25938 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we're investigating a few things from the vendor: 1.

26039 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We are checking in with Intelegain with this issue under , where the issue is similar, I have added a comment under there, and will revert here with further issues.
26404 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I sent a chaser to Intelegain on this.
26448 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Chaser sent to ITG.
26532 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: ITG has confirmed that the issue arise due to the an API that was not called - ""Update Payment Status"". They are currently how this happened and will provide an update. We have also requested for an impact list for the users who had this error log. Issue is tracked under .
26593 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has confirmed that issue stemmed from a failure in the API call during the “Update Payment Status” process and its associated API flows. This resulted in both statuses not updated. However, they are not able to replicate the issue to resolve it. We will collaborate closely with the vendor to compile an impact list, if feasible. Additionally, we will explore ways to enhance the reliability of the payment process and support future troubleshooting efforts, such as improving the existing codebase by implementing detailed parameter-level logging. This enhancement will enable us to capture and review all relevant inputs, making it easier to identify any missing or null values. I have dropped Finance Team an email on the following action required: 1. @Finance Team to validate payment is received by IHRP 2. DTO Team to work with vendor to pull the information from logs and fill in the missing fields (to be validated by @Finance Team using postman) a. Price and Transaction details (as per the amount received) b. Fee List Item c. Payment By d. Transaction Details (stripe record) 3. DTO Team to work with vendor to change application status back to ‘Submitted’ 4. DTO Team to work with vendor to change application status to ‘OA-Failed’ – candidate has completed assessment today.
26640 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the update, we will be referring to the email to Finance to follow up on this thank you.
26747 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We would like to follow up on this case to know if it can be resolved thank you.
26804 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Issue fix is on hold till we have hours procured. Rectification data shared with Finance for validation. Once that is verified, the vendor will assist to update in the application in CRM. We will update once that is done.
27262 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , We have reinstated the application details in CRM and routed this to Finance for verification. However, during the issuance of invoice, the initial invoice had an incorrect payment date. May we have your assistance to inform candidate of the discrepancy, and advise her to refer to the latest invoice with the correct payment date. Please refer to the SS of the 2 invoice sent.
27467 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang , do I wait for confirmation on verification from Finance before I reach out to candidate? I will advise candidate to refer to invoice sent on 28/07/2025 at 3:19pm.
27522 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi @Eunice, do I wait for confirmation on verification from Finance before I reach out to candidate? I will advise candidate to refer to invoice sent on 28/07/2025 at 3:19pm.
27558 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , Finance has confirmed that details are all correct. You may let the candidate know to ref to the latest invoice. 28/07/2025 3:19pm is correct.

The first ticket, #99888, concluded with our response on 8 July at 12:41 PM, where we requested a screenshot of the error to assist further. As of now, the candidate has not responded. The second ticket, #99889, was addressed by Alisha, who clarified that the issue stemmed from the assessment date selected in conjunction with the SFC payment method. The candidate must choose an assessment date within 60 days of the application date. We are currently awaiting the candidate’s response on whether she can select a new date. If not, we will proceed to delete the draft to allow her to reapply. Please let us know if further action is required and reopen this ticket thank you.

Additionally, we’ve noted that the candidate has not submitted any inquiry via Freshdesk. Kindly inform the candidate that we will revert once the investigation is complete. Thank you.
26370 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Candidate Details: Name: SOO HOON CHIA Email: cutezixuan921@gmail.com Application ID: 20250200469_3 Based on the email correspondence, the candidate was unable to begin the reassessment scheduled for 13 May 2025 and had reached out to eHelp for support. The response from eHelp indicated that the issue was being investigated and that someone would follow up with the candidate. However, no updates have been received since then. Kindly review the attached screenshot and the conversation in ticket #100233 for further details. Please check in with Prometric urgently and provide an update by the end of today. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang

26388 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Please find the screenshots below: Thank you.
26401 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , [Edit] We have escalated this to the vendor, please let us investigate and get back again on the next steps. Here's what we're checking with the vendor: 1. Checking if this issue is similar to , where the test has not been attempted, but already stated that the system states that the test already has been attempted upon system checks before taking the assessment. 2. We are asking for them to have a plan such that post-assessment issues should be routed to IHRP for service recovery Feel free to reach out if you have further clarifications. Thank you.
26455 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Any updates on the above?
26457 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently Prometric has mentioned that this issue is not related to , and could be a separate issue on it's own. Kindly allow some time for the vendor to investigate this issue further before we can revert back with a resolution to this. Thank you.
26591 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: An update from vendor; they have tested this on the live environment and were able to successfully start the test for the candidate. After completing the checks, all changes have been reverted to the original data. Based on the findings, if the candidate attempts to start the test now, she should be able to do so without any issues. Candidate may proceed to reschedule to resume assessment. FYI @Shu Ting Ang , please proceed on this first and flag as a technical and support issue not being followed up by Prometric Team. @Muhammad Hasan - please update once vendor has replied. However, root cause of why candidate could not start assessment is still pending - we will update again.
26633 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Vendor has replied stating: This cause was not generated on their system, causing them to be unable to identify the root cause the candidate's issue at that time. They could not trace any technical issues on their end. Feel free to reach out if you have any clarifications. Thank you. FYI, @Shu Ting Ang , @Eunice Chiang
26643 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Hasan and Eunice, Thank you for the information. We will informed BU to reschedule the candidate thank you. Hi Shelby, We will paste the same information in the email for your review thank you.

26738 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Please note that candidate has an existing OA-Failed application, which is why system is prompting that there is an existing draft application. I noted that this candidate OA-Failed for CA but applied new for CP and passed. In that case, since the CR for applying new cert when you have a previously OA-Failed application is not live in CRM, BU has to use the workaround which is to deactivate the OA-Failed application (with necessary approval) and proceed to allow candidate to apply.

The mismatch is suspected to be due to a merge in emails, causing conflict between the candidate IDs. You may check the candidate's ID accordingly by checking the link on CRM and in Prometric.

26459 • unknown • NaT • This issue has been affecting candidates since last year, where the macOS ‘Messages’ application runs in the background and interferes with the launch of the secure browser used for assessments. Our current workaround has been to instruct candidates to use the Force Quit function to terminate the application. However, we’ve recently discovered that this method does not effectively kill the ‘Messages’ process. Instead, candidates must manually open Activity Monitor, locate the ‘Messages’ process, and force quit it from there. This is not as straightforward as using a typical Task Manager and can be confusing or time-consuming for candidates, especially those unfamiliar with macOS system tools. We are raising this ticket to clarify the following with relevant business units: 1. What is the role of the ‘Messages’ process in relation to the secure browser? 2. Why does it interfere with the browser’s launch? 3. Is there a workaround or enhancement that can be implemented to prevent this issue from recurring? 4. Can the secure browser be improved to handle this process more gracefully or provide clearer guidance to candidates? Attachments and examples will be provided to support this issue.
26492 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, We are currently creating a comprehensive guide for installation that requires three things: 1. Enabling Cameras 2. Screen Sharing Permissions 3. Working around Kill Message Prompts by using Activity Monitor I will follow up here for further updates on the document here.

26592 • unknown • NaT • Joy- Hi Shu Ting, just to note the analysis of the candidate's journey below: 1. The candidate was part of the old assessment flow of EA then OA. 2. The candidate took EA, failed it. According to the old workflow, by right this candidate would bump down to CP. 3. However, this candidate was already CP certified in 2019 hence, this could be the reason why her SP certification journey ended so abruptly with IHRP. It is important that we confirm this analysis with Cert team. Kindly help to reach out to the requestor to ensure that we are aligned on the candidate's certification journey. Once we are aligned, i will provide the recommendation on the next step.
26644 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joy, Is the requestor the person who initially raised this issue? The candidate wrote in directly to Freshdesk, we will proceed to consult the certification team on this before reverting thank you.
26665 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh Please find Kah Boon comment below: ""Yes, Cheryl Tan has applied for the IHRP-SP upgrade application in 2022 and as she did not clear her EA, she is unable to proceed with the competency assessment. If she would like to apply for upgrade, would need L2 confirmation if her upgrade application must be deactivated. Thank you.""
26671 • unknown • NaT • Joy: Hi Shu Ting, in that case, the IHRP-SP application should first be deactivated to allow the candidate to submit a new application. An internal remark should be added to the application to document this. Once the candidate has submitted the new application, it can then be reactivated.
26681 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh Thank you for the information, we will close this ticket.

26487 • unknown • NaT • Joy: Added the model and system setting of the device the candidate is using.
26490 • unknown • NaT • Joy - Hi Jia Rong, we were able to identify the root cause of the issue. Please find the findings below. Root Cause Whenever Apple releases a security update, it may cause compatibility issues with our secure browser. Interim Workaround Prometric team currently developing a new version of the secure browser for MacBook users. For candidates using MacBooks who have contacted eHelp or our team, we will provide them with the latest version to ensure they can proceed with their assessments. Long-Term Consideration While I recognise that Apple’s updates are unpredictable, it remains important for us to explore a sustainable long-term solution for MacBook users. We have requested the Prometric team to prioritise this matter and begin exploring viable options. Next Step Since this is a technical issue, please proceed with the necessary step with the candidate so that he can proceed with his certification journey with IHRP.
26493 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joy, Thank you for the information, we will be pending for more updates on the latest version of the secure browser. Hi Jia Rong, I will be taking over this case thank you.
26701 • unknown • NaT • Joy: Hi @Shu Ting, this is the link to download the latest secure browser. It should only be shared with MacBook users facing screen sharing issues. https://tempo-2021.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/secure_browser/IHRP_SecureBrowser-6.0.70.pkg .
26745 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Joy, Thank you for the information, with that we will close this case thank you.

26590 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi All, this case is similar to . Escalated this case to Prometric Team with 2 impacted users. In the previously reported case, the issue was attributed to an outdated dataset. However, it remains unclear whether this qualifies as accessing a reused link from the IHRP Portal (when user comes to IHRP Portal to apply for Reassessment) We have done some analysis and observed that the issue might be due the following user flow: 1. Candidate applies and completes the EC 2. Proceeds to the Payment Page 3. Clicks ‘Back’ to return to the EC 4. Continues pressing ‘Back’ until reaching the IHRP Portal 5. Clicks ‘Apply Now’ again in IHRP Portal 6. Lands on a confirmation page showing a past assessment date Pending vendor to investigate and propose a permanent resolution. Will update again.

26736 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @ Hasan, Can you look into this as we have retriggered the access code but it is still showing IHRP-CA assessment. Thank you. FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang
26759 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , There could be an issue with the wording template, there could be a discrepancy in the email template which led to this problem. We will investigate with the vendor and revert for any updates. As for the candidate, please tell her that she can proceed, we have noted that on our end, she already is assigned the correct paper. Should further issues arise, feel free to let me know. Thank you.
26767 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Hasan, Thank you for the updates, may we confirm that the candidate is still taking the CP assessment despite the technical error indicated in the email before we revert back to the candidate? Thank you.
26768 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Yes, we can confirm that she is indeed assigned the correct papers from the backend. It is just discrepancy in displaying the correct info in the email sent to the candidate. Hope this clarifies.
26770 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the confirmation.
26772 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the update, please let us know when can the correct template be send to the candidate thank you.
26829 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent to vendor.
26830 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor could not replicate the case, they will provide an update by 30th July 2025 EOD. Thank you.
27460 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent to vendor
27621 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Vendor will provide update by 7th August EOD.
27808 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Hasan, do keep us updated on Prometric response, otherwise, please send a chaser for this. Thank you.
27823 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Cheryl , a chaser was sent yesterday. Will update here if there any updates from the vendor. Thank you.
27919 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Cheryl , this issue related to POI-335, pending vendor's QA verification. Regarding POI-335, knowledge transfer has been provided for L1s through email previously. Should the candidate still be unsure, you may provide the knowledge given in the email. Thank you.
28052 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Kindly elaborate on this knowledge transfer has been provided for L1s through email previously. In light of this, could you kindly clarify whether the vendor is able to implement a fix to prevent this issue from recurring? Additionally, we would like to highlight that sending an update email to a candidate who has already been certified may cause confusion. Please advise on how best to proceed in this case. Thank you.
28072 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The KT that Hasan was referring to is on the thread titled: Candidates face Email rendering issues when forwarded - However, please allow us more time to review the case wholistically as the behaviour doesn't seem to be the same as the previous causes logged in POI 335. Based on my analysis and reviewing the candidate’s SS provided, there is no form of email forwarding performed. When L1 regenerated the access code to her Gmail account, the received email showed IHRP-CA instead of IHRP-CP. However, I noticed that the screenshot provided shows the email was opened using the ‘Mail’ app from the App Store, suggesting that her Gmail is linked to this app. With that, we dropped an email to Prometric to confirm whether such a setup could result in discrepancies in how the HTML content is displayed. If yes, then this will fall into the additional information and KT that we will share with L1 for such cases moving ahead. Regarding a permanent fix, please note that based on POI 335, it is very difficult to implement such a fix as there are many variables out of the vendor's capabilities now, and this is a UI issue that does not impact candidate's assessment journey. Regarding an update to candidate, I noticed that candidate has already completed her full assessment, hence, i suggest just providing an update that IHRP noted and acknowledged on this email UI issue, and is working on it internally. I don't see any further updates required to be shared with the candidate on this. With that, i suggest we close the case for monitoring and we will update L1 if there are additional KT information or no further action can be done. FYI @Muhammad Hasan , please take note on such details when you investigate. You are missing out the details in the candidate's SS.
28203 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. We have informed the candidate that an internal fix is currently in progress. As mentioned, the candidate has successfully completed the assessment and is now certified. Accordingly, we will proceed to close this case for monitoring purposes. Thank you.
28547 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Update - no further findings from Prometric, ticket to be closed for monitoring and reopen if issue reoccurs.

27623 • unknown • NaT • Joy: hi L1, this is the current behaviour of the system. Since we have allowed either NRIC/ Passport as the identification type, the scenario where a user can hold 2 accounts is possible in the system. For now, we can manage the issues with merger of account. However, with more cases surfacing, a long term solution may be required. As we have a workaround for this, we will look into this as P2 priority.
27895 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Joy, noted on the findings. We have inform Cert Team on the workaround that we will need to merge the account. Pending for their approval to proceed with such cases (email sent on 08/08/2025). Thanks.

27837 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Zac, please assist in this ticket.
27920 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Joy, I’ve created a ticket on the DC3P Board as and asked our vendor to check the issue. I’ll keep you updated as soon as I receive any feedback from their side.
28193 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Zac, Any updates on the above? FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang
28217 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, Intelegain have investigated on this issue and thinks that the issue might be on Prometric’s side. When the user created the application, they chose the CP application for reassessment. The logs show the certification type is CP, and these logs are sent from Prometric to CRM. I’ll be checking with Prometric to investigate this further on their end.
28284 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. Kindly let us know if there is any update from Prometric.
28882 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Zac, Any updates on the above?
28909 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have taken over this ticket. Currently the vendor is looking into the CRM logs provided by Zac. I will be sending them a chaser for this ticket today. Should you have any further clarity needed, please let me know.
29012 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent again; 1/9/25
29145 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, Currently we are clarifying a few points with the vendor: 1. Based on the EC selection, the recommended level should have been SP. Could you clarify why the system recommended CP level instead? 2. The system recommended CP level, but the candidate was assigned an SP paper for the first attempt. This appears to be inconsistent. Could you explain why this mismatch happened? 3.After taking and failing a full SP paper, the candidate was then allowed to apply for another level (CP) during reassessment. Could you confirm why the system permitted this, and whether this is expected behavior? We will revert once the vendor has provided us an update.
29175 • unknown • NaT • Chaser sent 4/9.
29307 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Any updates on the above as this ticket has been pending for sometime since August thank you.
29340 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , They will provide an update by 9/9.
29507 • unknown • NaT • Chaser sent to vendor 10/9.
29690 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi All, an update on this issue. The vendor has provided an update that the root cause was due to an incorrect course–test mapping in the system. The test assigned to baharudin@nous.sg was “SP Full Paper RPT FF4-4”, which currently shows no course assigned, whereas in our system all tests are always assigned through courses. Due to this, it is causing a mapping error and issue is not related to the recommendation engine. We have routed this to A&I Team to validate and will update again if there are further findings.
29705 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the information. Appreciate if L2 can provide an update when A&I has reverted thank you.
29734 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi all, A chaser has been sent to A&I. Will revert as soon as there is an update. Thank you.
29799 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi all, Fixed forms are rotated regularly to avoid overexposure of items. Hence, SP Full Paper RPT FF4-4 shows no assignment now as it was already used in Q1 2025 and not meant to be assigned afterwards. Issue: Candidate was incorrectly assigned the SP paper due to a course–test mapping error. This test currently shows no course assigned, whereas all tests should always be mapped through courses. Concern: Despite the rotation, candidates who signed up/applied in Q1 2025 (but took the assessment later, e.g., May/Aug 2025) were still delivered the same fixed form. This suggests Prometric’s auto-reassignment of forms after rotation may not have occurred as expected. (Clarified by Ellenie) Clarification needed from the vendor: 1. Why did the system still deliver the rotated fixed form to these candidates? 2. Has this been happening for some time, or only recently? 3. Please confirm whether auto-update of fixed forms upon rotation is functioning as intended.

28192 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Zac and Justin, Any updates on the above? FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang
28218 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, Abby Yap - (1) Her payment is pending was due to Kahboon helping her to cancel her prev application and manual pushing an assessment for her so it will show as pending. As she has already paid for the previous one. (2) However, as we checked further into her application, we noticed that the date of assessment in CRM and Masterlist is inconsistent (Masterlist is the source of truth). For (1), there is no further action from L2. (2), we will check with the ITG. Aaron Wai - Payment is pending status was also due to manual pushing to prometric creating a assessment for him. There will not be any stripe payment since this is a manual creation. For your info on the candidate's journey, his previous payment in the application ID of ""20230800225"" was transfered over to the current application id: ""20250600284"". In the internal remarks it was mentioned by Rabiah and Shelby saying that she has been approved by Karina to take the SP assessment and to have her payment in old application ""20230800225"" to be transferred over to the new application ""20250600284"". There is on further action required from L2.
28427 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. Is there any update for Abby Yap (2) case?
28633 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Shu Ting, We are currently still waiting for ITG update on this issue. I’ll keep you updated as soon as I receive any feedback from their side. Thank You.
28881 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, May I check if there is any updates thank you.
29008 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, I’ve received an update from the vendor regarding the candidate’s application. Based on their investigation, the issue appears to have originated from Prometric’s side. I’ve already reached out to Prometric through email, and I am currently awaiting their response. I’ll keep you informed once I receive any updates. At this point, no further action is required from L2.
29146 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, The issue regarding candidate Abby Yap has been resolved internally. This case is linked to , where her previous application (20250500080) was cancelled by Kah Boon. Since the candidate had already made a payment for that application, the payment of her previous application was then transferred over to her new application (20250700028), which was also created by Kah Boon. As noted in the comments of , Kah Boon mentioned that a new application would be created with a future date following the deletion and requested support to expedite the change of the assessment date back to 4 July, as the candidate had taken company development leave specifically for that date. Additionally, Kah Boon has updated the internal remarks and has already completed the change of the assessment date from 15 July to 4 July. For the application (20250700028). There is no further action from L2.
29154 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Zac, Thank you for the information. We will close this case thank you.

28022 • unknown • NaT • Justin: Hi @Shu Ting, It looks like this issue is most likely an internet issue on the user's side. This is because in Stripe it is shown that there are only 2 successful payments made. In CRM Production, there are 3 payments shown but the second $109.00 transaction did not go through. Essentially, only 2 payments were made but in CRM it is displayed as 3. Please let me know i any further clarification is needed. Thank you.

27892 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Rabiah, We will assist to escalate to L2 to do a check on this and revert to you once we have an update.
27893 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Hasan, Please assist to look into this case as it might be of a similar issue to Ivy Poh's case [POI- 237]. Thanks. @Eunice Chiang
27901 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , Before sending out an email to the vendor, kindly check with the candidate if she would like to change her or keep her current specialization: Generalist. Thank you.
27904 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Hasan, Candidate is currently a Generalist. Please find the screenshot
27932 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Cheryl Cheryl, this case is indeed similar to POI-237, which dates back to the root cause in POI-182. Since the candidate is a Generalist, we will only remove the EA entry. We will assist to delete this and ask the candidate to retake it once the vendor has removed the EA entry. As mentioned, this issue affects candidates attempting EA before 29th May 2025, since there was a fix deployed on that date. For the affected group of candidates, we have to proceed with this: Find if there are duplicate attempts of EA upon payment. (Find an example in Jira) If so, we will request to remove the erroneous entries to vendors, so that candidates can retake their EA. a. If the candidate does not want to change their specialization, we will proceed to remove the EA entry. b. If the candidate wants to change their specialization, removing the whole entry would be necessary, which will need a reapplication. Currently, we are still exploring new ways to resolve issues like these. Feel free to reach out if there any further clarifications needed.
28040 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, May I check if there are any updates regarding the issue above? The candidate is scheduled for reassessment tomorrow, having previously failed both the EA and HR Competency Papers. As this appears to be a technical issue on our end, could you please advise whether the candidate is still eligible to proceed with the reassessment as planned? Thank you.
28062 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting, As discussed on call, please hold and inform the candidate that we will proceed to reschedule the candidate's assessment, and that she does not need to take the assessment tomorrow. The issue lies under the candidate being assigned the same EA paper, and since a max attempt for each paper is 1, it causes the EA Reassessment paper to be failed twice, after being reassigned the same paper. The vendor will have to look into this and get a fix for this. Currently, we are trying to implement a fix for this today, 14th August, and to cause as little conflict as possible, it is best that we reschedule the candidate to another day. Do give us some time to investigate this and get a fix for it as soon as possible. Thank you.
28065 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information and we will proceed to check on it again. Pasting the conversation we had with Rabiah via email for tracking purpose: Hi Rabiah, As discussed earlier, we are currently working on resolving the issue related to the EA assessment and expect to have a fix in place by today. In the meantime, regarding the candidate’s current situation, please inform them that this is a technical issue and they are not required to attend the assessment scheduled for tomorrow. We will update you once the issue is resolved so you can assist with rescheduling the candidate accordingly. Thank you.
28084 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have removed the EA entry for the candidate. Please inform the candidate to proceed with the EA. Please ignore any of the mentioned related issues below, as it is incorrectly related. Should any further issues arise, feel free to let me know. Thank you.
28189 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, May we clarify if the issues has been fixed and Rabiah can proceed to reschedule the candidate so that candidate can attempt both the EA and Competency paper? Thank you.
28228 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , An update on the root cause of the issue and summing up all points shared by Hasan. The root cause is due to a current assessment assignment set up in Prometric. As the logic now resets the attempt count based on the year of assessment, this candidate’s EA Reassessment attempts in both 2024 and 2025 are labelled as “Attempt 1.” However, only one paper exists for EA Reassessment Attempt 1, while there are two separate papers for the Competency Assessment Reassessment in 2024 and 2025. This discrepancy creates a gap in the EA Assessment component under the current logic. We’ve confirmed with Ayush that duplicating the EA Reassessment test is necessary as the configuration considers two variables: the attempt counts and the year of assessment. Therefore, we’ve aligned to duplicate the EA Reassessment test for this candidate—and for any others in the same situation—we will work with A&I Team and the Prometric team on a long-term solution. Please note that issue is fixed for this candidate and can proceed to reschedule her. Please inform candidate not to change specialisation during the start of assessment. The selected specialisation is Generalist.
28291 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice, Thank you for the information. Hi Rabiah, Kindly assist to reschedule the candidate and please inform candidate not to change specialisation during the start of assessment. The selected specialisation is Generalist. Kindly reopen this ticket if the candidate has any issues with the assessment thank you.
28331 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rabiah and @Shu Ting Ang , Noted that there is an issue to reschedule for the candidate. We have dropped an email to the vendor to check on this. Will update again.
28495 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: No update from vendor, chaser sent today.
28626 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rabiah, Please let us know what is the preferred date of assessment for this candidate - the vendor will proceed to with the update from the backend while we work on the fix for this issue.
28665 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang and Rabiah, Following the email confirmation from Rabiah titled FW: Reschedule date, kindly assist with rescheduling the candidate’s remote assessment to 15 September. Thank you.
28667 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Shu Ting, thanks for the update. We will route this to Ayush and get back once this is done.
28796 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi all, currently the vendor has provided some steps to validate a few steps to replicate the case the candidate is facing. Currently, I am working with the vendor to validate these steps, and will update here once there any results. Thank you.
28880 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Could you let us know the estimate timeline to resolve this thank you.
28911 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have performed an EA to validate the test steps, and routed the issue back for them to bring a result. The resolution provided by the vendor was by updating the assessment date from the backend. This scenario occurs only when an EA test is assigned with a different EA ID than the intended/required one, which causes the system to treat it as a previous attempt. Here are the steps provided: 1. Create/select a candidate and assign the HR Paper + EA as usual. 2. After assignment, change the candidate’s EA test ID to a different one than the required mapping. 3. Process/ingest results or refresh the status. 4. Observe that the EA result is recorded as a “previous attempt” due to the EA ID mismatch. I was required to do step 1 only. Steps 2-4 is for the vendor to configure and validate. We are currently awaiting for them to provide us an update on this. Feel free to reach out, should you need further clarity on this.
29140 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , please provide an update on your testing so far.
29144 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Eunice Chiang , @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we are still awaiting A&I to create a duplicate EA for testing, and once that is done, we will work with the vendor accordingly for this. Thank you.
29148 • unknown • NaT • Euince: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Separately, please note that candidate's assessment has been rescheduled to 15-Sep. Please assist to work with Rabiah to generate access code for candidate if required.
29174 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: A duplicate EA was created for the vendor to change the EA Test ID (UAT)
29308 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Rabiah, Any updates from the candidate? Hi @Hasan, Any updates for this issue?
29458 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently, we are still testing and working on the vendor on our end. We will provide updates on the results as soon as they revert. Thank you.
29706 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Any updates on the above thank you.
29736 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have already done the EA test with the steps the vendor provided. As mentioned in the ticket earlier, here are the steps: Here are the steps provided: 1. Create/select a candidate and assign the HR Paper + EA as usual. 2. After assignment, change the candidate’s EA test ID to a different one than the required mapping. 3. Process/ingest results or refresh the status. 4. Observe that the EA result is recorded as a “previous attempt” due to the EA ID mismatch. From my end, I noted that the EA result was NOT recorded as a previous attempt despite the EA ID mismatch. I am currently clearing this with the vendor. Will revert should there be any further updates. Thank you.
29743 • unknown • NaT • Hi Support, Candidate wrote to me on 13 September and claimed that she wasn't able to proceed as it prompted ""Test Invalid"". Kindly investigate. Thank you.
29748 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi 2Rachael, Could you please share a screenshot of the ""Test Invalid"" error? Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Kindly assist to check whether the candidate has attempted the assessment? Based on the screenshot, the score for the experience assessment appears to be the same. FYI @Eunice Chiang Thank you.
29749 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have routed this to the vendor following Rachael's comment. I have requested them to review whether the solution provided is functioning correctly as Hasan has also confirmed that it is not working in UAT. We will update again.
29817 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Vendor is looking into this and will provide an update by 17 Sep EOD.
29865 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: For testing, we would be retrying on replicating this case once again, working wjth the vendor on this.

27987 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Could we please clarify what the three cases are referring to—are they related to promo codes or null value payments?

We appreciate your patience as we take some time to investigate this case before proceeding with the deletion of her drafts.
28059 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Shelby, Upon review, the candidate appears to be using a draft application from 2024, which is why the payment status is showing as null.

The only way to mitigate this problem is to upgrade our plan, which is about $50 USD monthly, which the DTO team will not be doing at the moment.

28063 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joycelyn Goh , Upon reviewing the candidate’s record in CRM, we noted that there are three existing IHRP-SP applications submitted with payment via a corporate code. While these applications are reflected as submitted in CRM, they appear as drafts in Prometric. Could you kindly advise if this discrepancy is due to a system syncing issue? Additionally, we would appreciate your guidance on how we can assist in resolving this so that the draft can be properly inserted into Prometric. Thank you.

28784 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Shu Ting, Our vendor ITG couldn’t recreate the issue in UAT and thinks it might be a glitch from Prometric’s side. They suggest adding a check: if an application with the same Prometric Order ID is already submitted, the system shouldn’t allow creating another one. I’ll be writing to Prometric to ask them to investigate from their end as well. Will update you again once I have their reply. Thank You.
28878 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information, kindly let us know if there is any impacted on the candidate if he/she proceed with the assessment on the schedule date thank you.
28916 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I checked the CRM system and found that 2 out of the 3 applications were cancelled by Rachael. She will now proceed with her most recent application: 20250800191. Which is scheduled on 13-11-2025, at 14:00 to 18:00. Also checking on the Prometric site, it shows that she currently has only one active application, with an assessment scheduled for 13-11-2025, from 14:00 to 18:00. She can go ahead with the assessment on the scheduled date. Thank you!
28942 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. We will informed Shelby, please let me know if there is any updates from the vendor thank you.
29197 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Any updates on the above?
29209 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, I’ve received an update from ITG. The issue happens when a user clicks Proceed to Pay an application is created and synced to Prometric. However, the system currently allows another application to be created or paid for using the same Prometric Order ID, which shouldn't happen. To fix this, ITG proposes to implement a plugin that will check during application creation in CRM if an application with the same Prometric Order ID already exists. If one is found with the status Submitted, the system will block any new application from being created. We are still checking and discussing with them on the total estimated efforts to implement this fix. Will update you again. Thank you!
29310 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. Please let us know once there is an update on the estimated timeline thank you.
29708 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. Please let us know once there is an update on the estimated timeline thank you.
29735 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ShuTing, I’ve received an update from ITG. Here is the update from the vendor regarding the plugin development effort estimation: Total Estimated Effort: ~8 hours Development: 6 hours Testing: 2 hours Please note that this is a tentative estimate. The actual effort may vary slightly depending on the complexity of the task. I will be discussing further with Joy and Eunice on this implementation; I will update you further. Thank you.
29754 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @ ShuTing, Following further discussions with Joy and Eunice regarding this implementation, they have approved proceeding with the deployment of the fix. However, we’ve informed ITG that this fix will be treated as low priority, as there are currently two higher-priority change requests that require their immediate attention like and . I’ll keep you updated on any progress or feedback from ITG regarding the implementation. Thank you!
29827 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Zac, Thank you for the information. While we await an update on the fix, we will proceed to close the case on the candidate’s side, as there is currently no impact on the assessment. Thank you.

28534 • unknown • NaT • Justin: Hi Shu Ting, When Intelegain was checking the logs as well as creating an application in UAT, they found a second API called AssessmentReschedule API. For the user's case, there was an internet connectivity issue that prevented the API from being called. Therefore, the main issue here is that even though the user successfully paid and selected an assessment date, the API was not called due to an internet issue, and the new date was not captured in CRM and prometric.

28319 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , May we have you look into this with Prometric thank you. FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang Thank you.
28321 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Please find the logs from CRM that there was a draft for Reassessment created before and attach the SS from L1 with the draft for assessment dated 2 Sep and drop an email to Ayush to inform them on this. Get Ayush to confirm if there is any link regarding removal of reassessment appl on our end that links to Prometric appl.
28336 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang , I was unable to find any logs in CRM for this candidate. I tried using the candidate's ID, application ID and her email to filter her trace, but to no avail. Please let me know if there is any further action required on my end. Thank you.
28339 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Thanks Hasan. Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Please note that there are no logs found in CRM even for the creation of the reassessment draft so we will have to get the vendor to assist on this. Separately, please note that there is no sort of deletion of appl involved between the 2 systems other than Cancellation API which has a removal process. That said, we will still drop an email to Prometric to verify if any removal was done for this candidate using the SS you had. @Muhammad Hasan , please assist on this task.
28490 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , please follow up with the vendor on this.
28613 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi Eunice, Shu Ting I have followed up with the vendor, and will revert if there any updates on it. Thank you.
28843 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent yesterday, will revert if there are any updates.
28914 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has updated that there were no manual deletion from their end. The candidate’s second reassessment draft was removed because a different candidate subsequently occupied the same session slot. In such cases, the system checks whether the original candidate who had occupied the slot has completed their payment. The candidate's draft was incomplete. Subsequently, when a different candidate occupied the same session slot, the system validated whether the previous candidate had completed payment. Since the draft was incomplete, causing the system to show her already completed reassessment back in February. As mentioned below, I was unable to find the logs, there was no CRM event recorded for the auto-deletion. Hence, the vendor will deploying a fix for us to validate regarding a new audit log for auto-deletion of a draft. Do expect an update by 3rd September, where the vendor will providing test steps for us to validate this new audit. For further evaluation, proceed with the appropriate next steps for the candidate from your end. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang
28929 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Adding on to Hasan's comment, please take note that we are unable of such system logic where auto-deletion takes place. We are reviewing this with the vendor before we advise the next steps. Regarding the candidate's application, you may inform them to proceed as usual in the meantime. @Muhammad Hasan , please take note.
29040 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Chaser sent to Prometric Team;.
29141 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have gotten a response from Prometric Team that the draft is not visible due to the 'slot' being re-allocated to another candidate after 5 minutes if payment is not being made. However, we noted that the draft in the SS was a RPT slot - where there should not be any capacity limit. In this case, we need clarity on how the reallocation of slots takes place. We have posted the following questions to the vendor, and will provide an update once they have responded. This will help us with our product knowledge. 1. Does the CA/CP RPT have a seat capacity limit? If not, why are slots being taken up by other candidates? 2. Are the slots filled based on a 5-minute time frame or actual seat capacity? Other than that, please note that candidate has no more draft, and there is no linkage for deletion of draft from CRM to Prometric system. Hence, there's no further action is required from our end.
29321 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the information, kindly let us know if there is any update from the vendor thank you.
29342 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi ST, still no clarity on issue. Routed back to Prometric Team regarding further queries.
29569 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Chaser sent today. Will update again
29691 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: 2nd follow up shared on 11/9 - Vendor is not responding to the queries posted.
29816 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Update on this ticket. The draft that was 'removed' previously has been confirmed to be a CBT slot that was running at 9-6pm (which is not the norm) - hence the confusion. Hence, the logic of slot being taken over after 5 minutes applies in this case - which explains why the draft seen in Candidate tab was no longer visible after awhile. Please note that there is no issues with this as this draft does not affect the candidate application journey. If a slot is taken over, the next time when they enter the IHRP Portal, they will be prompted to reselect a new date after EC. Regarding RPT slots - there is no configuration that automatically releases selected RPT slots after 5 minutes if payment isn’t completed. RPT slots are only confirmed upon successful payment; there’s no 5-minute auto-release rule mapped for this flow. Hence, RPT slots and draft applications will remain till CR 8 is implemented. Hope this clarifies. If there are no further action required from L2, please close this ticket. thanks! FYI @Muhammad Hasan
29840 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice, Thank you for the information. Hi @James Wang , Please take note on the below updated investigation outcome from L2 thank you. We will close this ticket.

28324 • unknown • NaT • Hi Kah Boon, This case was previously raised under , but we have not received any response from BU. Based on the email, it appears that the candidate intends to proceed with recertification for IHRP-CP rather than reassessment. Please first confirm this with the candidate. Next, kindly ask the candidate to update their working experience, as multiple entries are currently marked “Yes.” If the candidate wishes to proceed with reassessment for IHRP-SP, she should be able to apply directly after updating her profile. However, if she prefers to pursue recertification instead, you will need to deactivate her current IHRP-SP application to allow her to apply, and then reactivate it afterward. Thank you.

28703 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joycelyn Goh and @Muhammad Hasan , Could you kindly look into this case where the candidate appears to have more than one application in CRM, both marked as “Submitted”? Additionally, Prometric is showing a “Draft” status, and we are currently unsure if it refers to the same draft. As a precaution, we are holding off on deleting the draft until further clarification is received. Candidate Assessment Date is on 15 Sep 2025. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang
28857 • unknown • NaT • JG: Please allow me to breakdown the issue. 1. Multiple application in submitted status - this is the current logic in place. Please refer to . (not a bug) 2. Why is 20250800291 submitted but in pending status - we will log a separate ticket with ITG to check on this. 3. Why did the candidate not receive the competency email - because there is no record in Prometric, hence no email sent. @Shu Ting, L1 may want to reinstate the missing application upon confirmation by the respective BUs while we check on issue 2.

29211 • unknown • NaT • JG: Hi Shu Ting, based on our findings with our vendor, we have identified the issue. 20250800142 - Used SFC, full claim. 20250800291 - Used Corp Code. @Shu Ting - please check with the candidate if he will be using SFC or Corp Code. This will determine the application to retain. Do check with Rachael to confirm if this candidate is a corp candidate. Issue in 20250800291: 1. Candidate used corp code but CRM did not capture it. Hence, based on our current corp code logic, application will be submitted and payment = pending. 2. Amount paid = $0 when it should reflect as ""$196.20"". We are still working with our vendors to find the root cause. Will keep you updated. Alternatively, you may track the progress in

Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Could you kindly check in with Eunice regarding this case to determine if any investigation is needed as to why it remains in draft status?

29479 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The investigation on CRM side is already managed by Joy, may I check what investigation are you referring to? Please note that the reason for it remaining as draft in Prometric should be due to the 5 minutes time out period. If you refer to the CRM audit logs for 20250800142, the time taken for the payment to be processed + updated was 9 minutes. @Muhammad Hasan , before any insertion of record, please get Ayush to confirm if there is any application ID referenced in the draft application for this candidate - so we can map the correct application to cancel in CRM as part of rectification after investigation is completed. FYI @Joycelyn Goh

28791 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Could you kindly check with Prometric to confirm whether the candidate has reached out, and determine if the issue is user-related? This will help us assess how best to assist further. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh
28792 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Please get Piyush to share ehelp transcript and the email correspondence with candidate and ihrpsupport@prometric.com.
28794 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , @Eunice, I have sent out an email to the vendor requesting the e-help transcript, and any details of the email exchange between the candidate and e-help support team. I will revert back if there any further updates. Thank you.
28915 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has provided an update regarding the email sent from the candidate. However, they were unable to find the transcript. Please expect an update soon, and I will attach the transcript and email from the candidate accordingly. Thank you.
29189 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor was unable to proceed to find the transcript. Therefore, we will use the forwarded email for our review. In that thread, the candidate has shown that she was connected to a Wi-Fi connection at the time of the incident. However, she was still encountering the error pop-up. We are checking the possible reasons why this error might still occur despite an active Wi-Fi connection, even though she had no LAN/VPN and no firewall. We will revert if there are any updates.
29313 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information, kindly let us know if this is technical or user issue thank you.
29353 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting, The vendor has reached out to us mentioning that it is likely that the candidate could not access the secure browser when a firewall, antivirus/endpoint security, proxy, or any network-controlling tool is blocking the connection—even if Wi-Fi is active and no LAN/VPN is in use. As a first troubleshooting step, please have the candidate try navigating to google.com from the same device and browser. If navigation fails or is intermittent, it indicates such controls are present.
29359 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , After providing the root cause, please state explicitly if this is a user or technical issue. This reply is not complete for L1 to proceed with the next steps. Do take note of this. Separately to Shu Ting, we will inform Prometric Support team to adhere to the recommendation below provided by them. However, this is good info for our internal team to know as well.
29365 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Eunice, will take note of this. Hi @Shu Ting Ang , vendor has shared that the issue is likely due to the candidate being unable to access the secure browser when a firewall, antivirus/endpoint security, proxy, or any network-controlling tool is blocking the connection — even if Wi-Fi is active and no LAN/VPN is in use. As a first troubleshooting step: Could you please check with the candidate if she is using a firewall?
29474 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the information. Hi @Ping Jia Rong , Please note that the candidate’s assessment has been rescheduled. In the meantime, kindly reach out to the candidate to address the issue mentioned above. It would be helpful to check whether the candidate is using a firewall, as this may be contributing to the problem.
29712 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Jia Rong, Any updates on the above, have you reached out to the candidate?
29753 • unknown • NaT • JR: Hi @Shu Ting, Yes, I have reached out to the candidate, but the candidate hasn't replied. I will send a chaser to the candidate. Thank you.
29814 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi All, please note that since candidate has not responded, we will close the ticket for investigation on Prometric end. Please note that if candidate responded that she was using firewall - please advice candidate to use other available devices that does not have firewall installed. Alternatively, advice user to effectively turn firewall off such that it does not interfere the secure browser software. If she did not - please furnish sufficient evidence to show (SS) else it is difficult to investigate at this point. Nonetheless, suggestion to use other devices is still recommended. FYI @Muhammad Hasan please take note
29839 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. We will proceed to close this ticket for now. Hi @Ping Jia Rong , Please follow up with the ticket accordingly and reopen this ticket if the candidate revert thank you.

29023 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, We are checking with L2 on the current application before reverting thank you.
29025 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , This candidate first attempted the IHRP-SP assessment on 1 July 2023, successfully passing both the Experience Assessment and the Labour Legislation Paper. Subsequently, she undertook two reassessments on 1 September 2023 and 1 February 2024, but did not pass either attempt. Please note that all assessments were conducted via Talview. On 1 September, the candidate raised a concern regarding the competency email, which indicated that she needed to complete the Experience Assessment in order to proceed with the reassessment paper. Could you kindly clarify why she is required to retake the Experience Assessment, despite having passed it during her initial attempt? Is this due to a data migration issue? As it is flag urgent by BU, kindly check in with Prometric thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh
29029 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , as spoken, please drop this issue to Ayush and note to him that: 1. Candidate has completed and passed EA in Talview, data in migrated report showed the same. 2. Why is EA still assigned in the Reassessment attempt? Share the SS of candidate prompted to do EA during the entry to secure browser. Please note to him as a priority case as candidate is unable to reschedule/reapply assessment till this is resolved.
29031 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang , @Shu Ting Ang , I’ve checked with the vendor regarding the candidate issue. The problem is that the migrated candidate was still being prompted for EA, even though she had already cleared it in Talview. In the Master List, the EA column was not set to “NA” but instead showed as “Generalist.” Because of this, she could not access her scheduled assessment today. (Screenshot was shared with vendor.) I’ve asked the vendor to: 1. Confirm why EA was still being assigned during the reassessment attempt. 2. Provide RCA. 3. Share next steps to resolve this. 4. Outline any testing steps if needed. This is marked as urgent, since the candidate is waiting while EA status is incomplete. Will update again once the vendor responds.
29096 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, Please note that this a data issue, whereby the data migrated was incorrect, causing the candidate to be prompted to retake her EA again. We are amending this, and will revert once the issue is resolved with the vendor. Thank you.
29315 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Any updates on the above and could you provide a timeline when the vendor will revert thank you.
29475 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Any updates on the above and could you provide a timeline when the vendor will revert thank you
29480 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have communicated this in weekly Prometric call that we requested Prometric Team to rectify this by today. We will update you again. @Muhammad Hasan - please be prompt with your regular follow ups and updates to L1 Team.

29688 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Migrated data rectification with some pending issues - routed back to vendor to rectify. Separately for kalpana.veva@gmail.com - checking with vendor how to let her proceed with assessment without retaking EA. Likely have to del appl and reapply on Prometric. We will update again.
29742 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Kindly ask the candidate for a proposed date/time for rescheduling, so that we can rectify the necessary with the vendor. Thank you.

29091 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , The candidate initially reported issues downloading the secure browser for their assessment scheduled on 7 August, via email on 8 August. Although the candidate also reached out to eHelp, there have been no further updates, and the case has since been redirected to Hello. Kindly refer to the information and screenshot below to help determine whether this is a user-related or technical issue, so we can advise on the appropriate next steps. Thank you.
29142 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Could you assist to reach out to Piyush for this candidate's ehelp transcript? Next, reach out to Ayush to check - why she is unable to to see Secure Browser or Chromium in the list to enable Location Services, and manage permissions? Hi @Shu Ting Ang , There are a few possibilities. User did not allow the installation of Chromium when prompted - if they do not allow, Location Services will not be detected. - User Issue. We will check if ehelp has provided assistance on this case - Support Issue.
29205 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has clarified the behavior on Mac devices: Chromium will only appear under Location Services once the candidate reaches the location screen and clicks “Get Location.” If Chromium is not listed, it usually means the candidate has either not reached the location screen or has not clicked “Get Location” to trigger the permission request. Once this step is done, Chromium should display properly under Privacy & Security → Location Services for enabling. However, we need further clarification from the vendor as the candidate mentioned she was unable to press the “Proceed” button referring to the video, which is before reaching the ""Get Location"" page. We will update once we have their response.
29477 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Any updates on the above as the candidate has indicated that this is company sponsored, she would need to provide a response regarding my assessment results. Kindly provide an update by tomorrow noon thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang
29571 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have sent a chaser but there was no response. Will update as soon as there is a response. Thank you!
29617 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Quick update: the vendor could not identify a definitive root cause. For now, let’s monitor the case. The vendor will personally be on standby when the candidate reschedules the next assessment to observe in real time. In the meantime, please advise the candidate to try using a different device (and, if possible, a different network) for the next attempt. Please let us know once you have rescheduled the candidate.
29629 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the confirmation. Please allow us to update again once we have reached out to the candidate.
29804 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, We are pending for the candidate to get another device before reverting with a preferred assessment date. Thank you.

29143 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , As discussed, we typically do not advise that candidate CAN use CTRL F function during the assessments, within the open book links as these links are external websites which is not maintained by IHRP. That said, we cannot control whether such functions usability at all times. Hence, L2 advice is to note this as 'If function is usable during assessment, please feel free to use it'. Nonetheless, we are validating this in Prod today for a better clarity on the usability based on our experience. @Muhammad Hasan , please assist to validate during your Prod Testing and attach the test results in Video format for L1.
29173 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi all, I have proceeded to test the CTRL F function during assessments within open book links. As per our results, we noticed that only MOM websites allow CTRL F within their website. Please refer to the video recordings in Jira. Thank you. SSO TAFEP MOM

So when a user hits the character limitation, they are aware of why they cannot input anymore characters and this will also allow the user to rephrase the description before submitting the ticket. Would you think this is a better workaround? Thank you.
29532 • unknown • NaT • JR: Hi @Justin, That sounds like a good workaround, especially since there’s currently no alert to inform users when they’ve reached the character limit. Kindly proceed with the change. Thank you.

29339 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting, We have advised Shelby that this cannot be inserted in time for assessment today as this is a SP RPT slot - which requires advance planning with no. of proctors required for assessment.

29536 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rachael, We will verify whether the system prompted for the environmental check when the candidate logged in. Based on the records, the candidate completed the assessment on 8 September and a reassessment entry was created on 9 September. However, the reassessment currently appears as ""not attempted"" in the system. Could you kindly clarify whether the reassessment was manually created, and if the candidate has indeed attempted it? Thank you.
29540 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, The issue happened on 8th September when she was doing her assessment. Her reassessment was created by me as we have complimentary reassessment for EA. Hope this explains.

29625 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , The candidate has reported that the system did not prompt for the environmental check upon logging in. This occurred three times during her assessment on 8 September. Could you kindly verify if this is a technical issue on our end? Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh
29682 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rachael and @Shu Ting Ang , Based on our analysis, there was indeed 2 consecutive rounds of system security check prior to her assessment. However, please note that the 3rd check was likely due to her exiting and re-entering the assessment at around 11am. With that, we will log a ticket to the vendor to confirm on the 2 consecutive rounds of security check. Do note as this is a SP RPT assessment, this may be requested from the proctor themself - we will confirm with Prometric on this. If this is so, then it is not a technical issue. First check: 08-09-2025 09:00:20:AM Second check: 08-09-2025 09:09:19:AM Third check: 08-09-2025 11:05:13:AM We will provide an update again on this.

Please note that Shelby has already contacted the candidate, and we will escalate this issue to Level 2 support for further investigation regarding the missing rescheduling fee in CRM. Thank you.
29703 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh , Please note that the candidate has completed payment for the rescheduling fee; however, it is currently not reflected in CRM. Kindly refer to the screenshots provided and assist in checking why the date appears as 22 October 2025 in both CRM and Prometric, yet there is no entry under the ""Reassessment Reschedule"" tab. Could this be due to the candidate selecting an incorrect date during the payment process? We are still awaiting confirmation from Finance regarding the date. Thank you.
29744 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh , Apologies for the miscommunication the CRM system now reflected the correct information and no action is required on our end. We will close this ticket. Hi @Finance, Thank you for the information, as discussed no action is required on DTO side now that the data is syncing therefore as a suggestion kindly reached out to Shelby to confirm on the rescheduled assessment date thank you.

29693 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Kindly assist in requesting Prometric to urgently insert the assessment, as the scheduled date is 15 September. Thank you.
29695 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , noted on the request, i will drop an email to Prometric Team to reinstate on priority. However, please note that 15/9 is Mon so we will get Prometric to do it on best effort basis. Based on the audit history, the selection of assessment date to payment made took more than 5 minutes - hence this may be the root cause. We will get vendor to confirm on this on another thread.
29715 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the information. Hi @Ping Jia Rong , Please note that this is an urgent case. Kindly inform the candidate that the assessment has been successfully inserted and they may proceed with it. Thank you.
29833 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Could we close this ticket or will you be updating the comments from the vendor on the root cause thank you.

29747 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Could you kindly assist to reinstate the application in Prometric thank you.
29800 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , This application cannot be reinstated as the assessment has already past. It is encouraged to reschedule from CRM first, before I can reinstate the application for the candidate. Thank you!
29819 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Please note that once assessment has passed, candidate is UNABLE to reschedule from IHRP Portal themselves. Only IHRP admin OR Prometric can reschedule for the candidate if this case is a valid no-show - where candidate missed the assessment due to not receiving the email from Prometric end. @Shu Ting Ang , based on the audit history, the entire application took over 10 minutes - which is probably the cause of this. @Muhammad Hasan - please get Ayush to confirm as there seems to be a rise in the cases reported lately due to the known slot expiry issue. Check if there is other underlying issue.
29835 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. We would like to confirm the current process: should the assessment be inserted before the BU team can assist with rescheduling the candidate, or should the rescheduling be initiated from CRM first—as mentioned by Hasan—before the application can be reinstated for the candidate? Hi @Ping Jia Rong , Please follow up with the candidate to confirm their preferred date and time for rescheduling the assessment.

29823 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Rachael, We will check in with the L2 team before providing an update. Thank you. Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Flagging this ticket as urgent, we have reviewed the details in Prometric prior to assisting with the email address update. Kindly review the attached screenshot and advise accordingly. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh
29824 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang and Rachael, This error occurs when the same candidate ID is being used in Prometric for a different email address. Upon further analysis, i noted that the email change request was raised in - but the change of email was done incorrectly when raised from L2. Hence, there is a pending draft with the incorrect email (mapped to same candidate ID) in Prometric (see SS in jira). If BU would like to use CR 4 to create manual application for candidate, we will need to request Prometric Team to remove draft in Prometric. After that, since the email updated in CRM is accurate, BU may proceed to push to Prometric again and the correct email will be sync over. Hope this clarifies.
29825 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information, kindly proceed to request for Prometric Team to remove draft in Prometric for BU to continue with the application thank you.
