17091 • unknown • NaT • New candidate has been reported: tammy.tan81@hotmail.com
17147 • unknown • NaT • For candidates that are given a reassessment attempt due to this error have to complete both papers. There are 2 possible cause: The candidate was rescheduled to a different mode (RPT to CBT). The candidate was rescheduled to an assessment date that is two months later. Both of these changes will result in a different paper type due to internal paper rotations. Therefore, it is advisable to establish a best practice approach for rescheduling candidates who have partially completed their assessments due to technical issues. Nevertheless, this issue should not surface after the deployment on 20 th Aug. Recommendation – Rescheduling of assessment for candidates who attempted assessment midway Assessment mode should not be amended in this scenario. Provide the candidate’s application date and the date on which rescheduling is made to A&I for confirmation of paper assignment and to recommend available assessment dates. In the event if the same paper cannot be assigned due to paper rotation schedule, the candidate will have to reattempt the newly assigned paper.

Date raised: 28/3/2024 Candidates email: christabel1991991@gmail.com , shwujiun@gmail.com Email thread: Re: [Urgent] Candidates unable to take Onsite Assessment - 28 march 2024, Re: Discrepancy in the slots on Prometric database Context: Both candidates arrived for their onsite assessment for their afternoon slot (2pm to 6pm). However, they were denied entry by the onsite staff who claimed that they have selected the morning slots (9am to 1pm) instead. Upon further investigation by the IHRP team, we discovered that our CRM system accurately reflected the assessment timing as 2pm to 6pm. However, when we downloaded the attendance list from the Prometric system, it showed the timing as 9am to 1pm, leading to a discrepancy in the data. After consulting with the Prometric tech team on our WhatsApp group, it was confirmed that the backend also indicated the slots as 9am to 1pm. We then requested the candidates to provide the competency email they received from Prometric, which indeed confirmed their selection of the 2pm to 6pm slots

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
16867 • unknown • NaT • we discussed this issue during our weekly call with Prometric. They assured us that they would attempt to replicate the issue in their Sandbox environment as an initial step, as this discrepancy had not occurred in previous testing. However, they did not provide an estimated time for completion of the investigation during the call.
16868 • unknown • NaT • This was a bug where a candidate selected a slot initially, but changed his mind to choose for another date. However, he did not select a new slot in the new date and proceeded to the payment summary page. The issue: This resulted in the system capturing his initial slot with the latest assessment date By right, candidate should be prompted when he did not select a new slot with the new date Fix deployed in sandbox, pending D&T to check before deploying to Prod
16869 • unknown • NaT • Validated on sandbox. Ready for deployment

Date Raised: 15/7/2024 Candidate’s Email: wong_yuk_ting@outlook.com Email Thread : 13 July - Unable to take EA paper, 13 July - Unable to take EA paper - wong_yuk_ting@outlook.com Context : Candidate is unable to start her EA paper after selecting her specialization 15/7: A&I provided details to Prometric such as how the test has been assigned correctly. 15/7: Prometric replied that they have checked in the backend, but no EA exam is scheduled for this candidate. They requested for the email received by the candidate. 15/7: A&I replied that she is not exempted from EA and should be completing the EA. Asked CCE to request for the email received by the candidate.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
16938 • unknown • NaT • Chaser sent to PPC to share the candidate’s competency details email for further investigation
17022 • unknown • NaT • Chaser sent to PPC
17027 • unknown • NaT • Candidate’s competency email is shared with Prometric team. Pending Prometric team to revert
17083 • unknown • NaT • Prometric has replied that EA should not be given to the candidate. Prometric team has tested the logic for the same selection on SandBox.
17148 • unknown • NaT • A&I replied that “This was the candidate Ankit said that should not do EA, but based on the eligibility she should be doing EA, where he asked for the candidate email. Looks like something is not right with the candidate assignment at the backend. EA is active and assigned to the correct candidate group - there are 36 entries for this test, and there are completions on this in Aug so it is not an issue with this test.”
17193 • unknown • NaT • Prometric investigated and suspect that “As we have checked with the database record and we found that candidate has selected the IHRP Recognised Qualification and that particular record was deleted from the master table as per my understanding the candidate has selected the skill badge if I check the same on Sandbox master table. So, that is why candidate is unable to start the EA examination.
17194 • unknown • NaT • Candidate support has ended as candidate is able to take her EA. However root cause is still to be investigated again as skill badges options should be disabled in Production.
17195 • unknown • NaT • At the same time, we need to check for other candidates who have selected the same options to check if they have encountered issues with their EA. These candidates are: sywu2000@yahoo.com (No application in Prometric) harveersingzz@gmail.com (CA Cert) blackiiejoe@gmail.com (EA Completed) jasperhejingpei@gmail.com (EA Completed) wong_yuk_ting@outlook.com (No EA) goh.ppeii@gmail.com (No Application in Prometric)
17396 • unknown • NaT • Since there is only 1 impacted candidate, we will be closing the ticket here and will continue to monitor if this error reappear again

Problem:
Date raised: 28/3/2024 Candidate’s email: felicialimjl@outlook.com Email thread: RE: Test not publish - Onsite assessment Context: A candidate scheduled to take an onsite assessment for SP full paper CBT-FF3. However, upon attempting to start her assessment at the test center, she encountered an error message - “Test not published.” When she brought this issue to the attention of the invigilator, she was informed that there was no immediate solution available after contacting Prometric. Consequently, she was unable to proceed with the assessment and was sent home. Internal Investigation Upon conducting an internal investigation, we discovered that the test was marked as “Inactive.” Further inquiry with our business users revealed that no one from IHRP had made any changes to the paper after it was initially made live, and typically, all tests should remain “active” by default.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
16932 • unknown • NaT • – based on the logs, the test was left “unpublished” on 26th December 2023 and was only published on 28th March 2024. If that was the case, how did the candidate manage to apply for application as there would have been an error message during the eligibility check?
16933 • unknown • NaT • The error message ""Test has not been added for this certification"" does not apply for inactive tests. It will only appear when a candidate attempts to register for a group without any registered test.
16934 • unknown • NaT • Verified with Ying Hong that Prometric's explaination aligns with A&I team's understanding, allowed to close the case.

Date Raised: 1st March 2024, Friday Candidate’s Email: Aliciatung20@gmail.com Email Thread: Urgent meeting - Prometric assessment issues and operations support Context: Prometric did not update the resolution on the same day. According to the update on whatsapp, initial suspicion was because user did not allow screen sharing. Candidate managed to attempt assessment after support has reached out to her on email. 19/3: Prometric informed us that the reason could be because the proctor did not approve the room sanitisation. Therefore, the candidate was stuck at 99%. 20/3: D&T reverted with the following questions on the comment by Prometric on 19/3. Was there anything unauthorised in the room that's why the proctor did not allow this candidate to go through? If yes, the proctor should have communicated to the candidate on the spot if any adjustments need to be done on her end. 2/4: The reason why candidate was stuck at the room was because there was no proctor approving the candidate to enter the assessment. Solution provided: to have backup proctor. Pending nancy to revert on how long does it take for each proctor to attend to each candidate at a time.

Problem:
Date raised: 7/3/2024 Context: The issue was raised on 7 March, Thursday. The key should be constant once we go live. We will deploy the code by the day after tomorrow on Sandbox as well as Production. One of your developers accidentally change the key in Sandbox. To prevent this from happening again in Sandbox, please ensure that the access to use this function is limited to a selected group of people. When the button is hidden, no one can generate an API Key from Sandbox or Production. In the Production environment, your team will implement logic where the regeneration key button will not be visible if the API is already generated. This measure aims to prevent accidental changes to the key. Yes, will do it.

Date raised: 28/3/2024 Candidate’s email: tammy.tyj@gmail.com Context: During an onsite assessment, a candidate arrived without her physical identity card, leading to her denial of entry to the assessment venue. While we acknowledge the the policy where physical Identity card needs to be presented, the concern arose when the onsite staff refused to communicate with the IHRP Ops team. The candidate contacted the IHRP Ops team in an attempt to resolve the situation and gain permission to proceed with the assessment. However, when the candidate handed the phone over to the staff at the test center, they responded dismissively, stating: Candidate\"" Im passing this phone cox IHRP is on the line. \"" Onsite staff: \""we will not speak to IHRP cause we have our own connection\"" Candidate was sent home.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
17356 • unknown • NaT • DTO checked the recording and found that the “Next” button disappeared during her assessment which caused the timer to stopped. DTO suspect that it is the reason why the candidate thought that her assessment was terminated
17357 • unknown • NaT • PPC request Ying Hong to advise when is it appropriate to reschedule this candidate.
17358 • unknown • NaT • DTO have verified that the candidate has completed her assessment with a OA-Failed status. In that case rescheduling this candidate would not be possible. The candidate would have to take the full HR paper during her reassessment. Requested YH to advise if a waiver should be granted for this candidate as this candidate did encountered “The next button disappeared” issue. However, we are not able to validate that the assessment was terminated before the submission as there was no recording of her submitting the assessment. On top of that, the candidate has submitted an MC for 2nd August
17492 • unknown • NaT • A&I has verified that the candidate has attempted all the questions in the 2nd paper but was jumping around the questions. Based on the submission, her responses were defintely submitted beyond the first few qns: Given that she was on MC, A&I suggest that we can waive the reassessment fee on the basis of MC, not technical error.
17560 • unknown • NaT • DTO replied that Kindly refer to Ying Hong's response below and inform the candidate that she can retake her paper with waiver. Based on the master list report, she will retake the HR paper.

17707 • unknown • NaT • DTO replied that we can see that she has failed her EA. May I clarify on the statement further “has passed her papers and EA but apparently it is not updated in Prometrics”? By “not updated”, do you mean that the EA score and outcome is not reflected correctly?
17708 • unknown • NaT • Cert team replied that She was from prometrics, there was a technical error, she was switched to Talview. Her assessment was done on Talview. The EA was cleared later on. I am asking Shanice if we can retrieve data from Talview on these. I have brought this case up to Ying hong and I remember looking at the information that showed the candidate have passed. So far I have not heard from Shanice. The candidate has completed her assessment however that data is missing. We need to find it.

17714 • unknown • NaT • A&I replied that: We have checked on Talview and EA: She completed Talview competency assessments and passed She failed her self-EA. She had submitted her written EA, however a lot is missing in her submission and hence was recorded as Not Clear. Based on this, she would have failed due to EA fail. Suggestion is because the written EA was so sparse: Get her to complete the written EA again (attached original submission) Then we evaluate the overall status. If she fails at written submission, then her status is Failed, and it goes into the migrated list for transfer to Prometric If she clears, her status needs to be manually updated to OA passed on CRM, following the Talview flow. Her application on Prometric should be deleted in any case because her assessment was completed eventually on Talview flow.

22016 • unknown • NaT • Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – Blue Screen in Secure Browser Issue Summary: Resource link was displaying a blue screen while clicking them. Initial investigation suggested that the issue was related to the internet bandwidth, but later investigation suggested a Java error. Root Cause: The secure browser relies on Java for execution, but a variable that should be cleared (or ""killed"") after use was persisting instead. This stale variable interfered with page rendering or authentication, leading to a failure in displaying content. Possible Causes: Memory Retention Issue – The Java application was not releasing or resetting the variable after a process completed. Session Handling Error – If the variable was linked to user sessions or authentication, it caused the browser to get stuck in an invalid state. Garbage Collection Delay – Java’s automatic memory cleanup (garbage collection) did not run at the expected time, leaving old data active. Variable Scope Issue – The variable was declared in a way that kept it alive beyond its intended use. Browser Rendering Conflict – If the stale variable was used in page rendering logic, it prevented proper loading, resulting in a blank or blue screen. Impact: The secure browser failed to load the resource links. Users were unable to access required content. Potential service disruption for users relying on this functionality. Immediate Workarounds: Cleared the cache and restarted the secure browser to check if it reset the variable. Checked for Java exceptions or errors in the logs to identify the exact point of failure. Reloaded the page in a different browser to confirm whether the issue was specific to the secure browser. Resolution & Fix Implementation: Our developers have implemented a logic fix to properly kill the old variable after its intended use. This prevents the variable from persisting and causing a blue screen. The fix has been pushed into the dev environment for testing. We will update the IHRP team by March 3 rd with

Problem:
We had a candidate who took her assessment today and encountered an issue where she couldn't click on any selections. Additionally, the timer stopped working. Here are the candidate's details: Candidate GUID: 73ced01e-77df-ef11-a731-6045bd200cd0 Device: MacBook Pro Intel Secure Browser Version: 6.0.73 The candidate exited and relaunched the secure browser, which allowed her to complete the assessment.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
23969 • unknown • NaT • 10 April - The candidate's ability to continue the assessment after relaunching the browser further supports the theory of a temporary connectivity disruption rather than a persistent application issue.

Upon further investigation, we noticed two anomalies in the masterlist report: The candidate's 1st and 2nd reassessments were assigned the same competency assessment paper. This should not be the case based on our understanding. Pending Prometric to confirm if this is a technical issue with the paper assignment. For record S/No. 2, the 'Date of Competency Assessment' and 'Scheduled Assessment Date' are different. According to the status report, the candidate took their assessment on 07/03/25.

Step 3: After, click on the EA Link; it will show you the error that the paper has already submitted. Now go to the scheduling of the reassessment by clicking on the apply now button from CRM and complete scheduling. Issue resolved and validated in Production.

Date raised: 30/4/25 Email Thread: [POI-196] - Navigate to assessment past date instead of EC Candidate: pro.x40@mailto.plus Issue Description: I am attempting to apply for an Upgrade through the admin portal from the candidate tab in UAT Env. However, when I clicked on Upgrade, I was redirected to a screen displaying that the assessment has passed (showing my previous assessment information) instead of navigating me to EC to select an Upgrade.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24091 • unknown • NaT • 8 May: This issue occurred because the candidate in question belongs to an older data set. At that time, the system was misbehaving due to incorrect data being fed, especially when old or reused links were accessed by some candidates. As a result, this particular candidate is being affected due to legacy behavior. Explanation: This link was previously used by another candidate, and during that time the system entry was misbehaving. The current candidate is also from that same period. Kindly try creating a new candidate profile and replicate the case — if you still face the same issue, please let us know and we’ll investigate further. So far, this issue does not occur with newly created candidates, and the Upgrade navigation works as expected.
24134 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Closing the ticket with Ayush's confirmation that issue does not occur with newly created candidates. Additionally, issue happened to a test account in the UAT Env, data could be dirty while we have ongoing testing with different accounts. With that, we will close the ticket and monitor.

Pending Prometric Team to relook at this case and revert. Email: margaret.ching@gmail.com
25151 • unknown • NaT • Hi Eunice, any update on the margaret.ching@gmail.com? Thank you.
25185 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rachael, Apologies for the delayed update - vendor has just gotten back. The vendor has attempted to investigate the issue and tried to apply from their end with a test data. During the check, they managed to apply successfully. They have removed the test data and this flow is now working as expected. Please inform the candidate to disregard any emails received and may proceed to reapply for Reassessment on her end. Do let us know if issue is resolved after.

24556 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Prometric has followed up with us and has recommended the following for the candidate to not face the same issue in future when taking assessment. 1. Ensure that no other application (e.g., MS Teams, Zoom, Skype, camera app) is using the camera in the background. 2. Allow all permissions when prompted by the Secure Browser (camera, microphone, screen). 3. Close any screen capture, recording, or remote desktop applications before starting the test. Avoid selecting specific windows — always choose entire screen during screen share prompt. We strongly advise informing candidates to perform these steps before test day and confirm settings if prompted again during the session. Thank you.
24560 • unknown • NaT • So would you categorize this as a technical issue? cos if it is a technical issue, then we would reschedule her free of charge. Thank you
24561 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, This is more of an advanced user issue. These instructions from Prometric were not clearly stated in the competency email. Hope this clarifies. Thank you.
24585 • unknown • NaT • Hi Hasan, As I understand from you yesterday, the issue is due to some apps running in the background when the candidate was doing her assessment. But this runs contrary to what we know is that when the secure browser is active, it ""kills"" all apps in the background. Please help to further confirm with L1 and Prometric as this could happen for future users. For this case, I will reschedule the student.
24746 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , currently as noted from the CRM, Shelby has not scheduled an assessment with her yet, we are still waiting for her to schedule, before we can mark this as resolved.

Candidate Email: chiowhui1989@gmail.com Email Thread: Issue Description: The candidate has encountered a similar issue where they were unable to connect to the internet during the assessment.

Due to the situation, they were quite nervous and attempted to submit several times. Kindly assist by requesting the eHelp transcript and reviewing the attached screenshot to determine the next steps. Thank you.

24749 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, Kindly ask the candidate if there is any proof of her reaching out to e-help as Prometric has confirmed that they have not received anything from the candidate. Thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang @Joycelyn Goh @Shu Ting Ang
24784 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, Apologies for the late follow-up. The root cause of the issue is it being where the entire network is routed through a VPN—such as in some office environments—we are currently unable to detect this at the network level. In such cases, we display a message notifying the user about the detected VPN usage. You may follow up on the candidate to reschedule as the reason for the error was not display clearly for the candidate. We are working on a fix for this. Thank you.

24811 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang and @Cheryl , Regarding the use of VPN - We have deployed information on use of VPN and company laptop in the candidate competency assessment details email on 21/05. Candidates who have this issue and are unable to resolve the issue will be deemed as user issue. However, we noted that candidate has applied on 06/05, so this information was not conveyed to her. Regarding eHelp support - Prometric Team has confirmed that candidate did not reach out to them for support so we are unable to confirm if support was lacking as per what the candidate claimed. Hence, we are unable to confirm if this is a user or technical issue. However, given the extended turnaround time for the L2-level investigation and the absence of communication with the candidate, we recommend that the BU reschedule the session as a service recovery measure. Please also inform the candidate that the issue likely stemmed from the use of a VPN, and strongly advise using a personal laptop for the next attempt. If there are no further actions required from L2, please proceed to close this ticket. FYI @Muhammad Hasan
24828 • unknown • NaT • Hi Eunice, Thank you for the detailed information. We will route this case to bu for review and close this ticket,

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24297 • unknown • NaT • From: Ayush 🔍 Root Cause: The candidate had originally taken the test in the previous year . When the candidate applied for an upgrade or reassessment in the current year , an issue was triggered during the application process. This occurred because the system logic did not correctly handle scenarios where the year changes , resulting in an incorrect Repeater Status value. Due to this, the system assigned the wrong group to the candidate after submission, and when the candidate attempted to apply for an upgrade or reassessment, the system incorrectly displayed a “Test already attempted” message—despite the reassignment being valid. ✅ Fix: We have updated the logic to correctly validate reassignment and submission status in cross-year scenarios. This fix has been tested and verified successfully in the sandbox environment. 🧪 UAT Test Case Steps: Assign an EA or Full Paper to a candidate and have them complete the test in a previous year (e.g., 2024) to simulate a historical attempt. In 2025 , apply for an upgrade or reassessment for the same candidate. Verify that the correct test is assigned to the candidate. After submitting the new test, apply for another upgrade or reassessment to confirm the candidate can successfully reattempt, and the correct status and group are applied.

24559 • unknown • NaT • 3 June - this ticket has been deployed successfully on 29th May 2025.
25311 • unknown • NaT • Background A candidate completed an assessment in 2024 and reapplied for a reassessment in 2025. During the second application in 2025, a system error occurred, incorrectly indicating that the candidate had already taken the assessment—even though they had not done so in the current year. System Logic Issues Identified Year Change Not Handled Properly The system didn’t correctly account for the fact that the candidate’s original test was taken in a different year. This caused a misinterpretation of the candidate’s Repeater Status—a value that determines the no. of assessments taken in a year. In this instance, the candidate’s repeater status was incorrectly carried over from the previous attempt, which led the system to mistakenly mark the new entry as already completed. Incorrect Group Assignment Because of the faulty Repeater Status, the system assigned the candidate to the wrong group after submission. This group assignment is crucial for determining the assessment paper to be taken. As candidate was assigned to a previous attempt's group, assessment is automatically deemed as taken. Error Message Pop-up When the candidate tried to do her assessment, the system showed a “Test already attempted” message. This message was triggered due to the above issues, where the system believed the candidate had already taken the test, even though the assessment was valid. Deployment Date 29/05/2025

24733 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, Please ask the candidate to add a new row of record to re-tabulate the HR experience and let us know if this resolves the issue. Please find the reply from the vendor for your reference: We investigated the issue and found that it occurs because all the experience records were created on the same day. There is a field called Total Experience, which is asynchronous and calculated by the system. When a new record is created, a plugin is triggered to update the Employment Last Update date. This update then triggers a contact flow that checks the Total Experience value. However, at that point, the system has not yet updated the Total Experience field, so its value is still 0. Since the calculation takes some time, this delay causes an incorrect value to be shown.

Do let me know the root cause and I will inform Kah Boon. While you are checking, I am waiting for Kah Boon to revert on the payment mode. Thanks
24359 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , you are right for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg . This seemed to be a manual creation, no payment found as well. I have logged a ticket with ITG for further analysis. For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com , by right, candidate should cancel the application in the front end portal in order to call the cancellation API which would simultaneously cancels the application in Prometric. In this case, Kah Boon has manually cancelled the application for the candidate via CRM which is why the application still exists in Prometric. If this application has been confirmed to be cancelled, you may reach out to prometric directly to remove the application in Production. However, it is important to advise BUs to let the candidate cancel the application on their own else, there would be manual intervention like this case.
24361 • unknown • NaT • Ticket has been raised in DC3P under 580.
24365 • unknown • NaT • Hi Kah Boon, For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, for cases if candidate has active applications with "" Assessment scheduled "" in Prometric, it is advisable to get candidate to cancel at their end and apply a new application. Manual intervention on creation of application will cause this issue. May we confirm if you would like to proceed with the cancellation of assessment in Prometric before we raised a request to prometric. As for lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg and leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg, L2 is currently investigating with vendor on this.

24523 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , The issue has been identified for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg . Root cause: A required field in the user profile was left empty (residential status). As a result, although the application was successfully created in Prometric via the CreatePrometricManualApplication API , an error occurred in CRM. This caused the application to remain in draft status despite the API call being successful. Next steps: We are currently working with Intelegain to explore potential fixes. Please see the proposed rectification plan below: Once the respective BUs confirm the impacted candidates, please let us know so that we can have intelegain trigger the API via postman to update the application status.
24526 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rabiah, As discussed. There is no action on our end for item 3. For items below we have: 1. Draft removed for kairi.nomeru@gmail.com 6. Draft removed for wendy_yoong@yahoo.com 7. Draft removed for Tan_Ying_Tong@Psd.Gov.Sg
24569 • unknown • NaT • Hi Rabiah and Kah Boon, The issue has been identified for leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg. Root cause: A required field in the user profile was left empty (residential status). As a result, although the application was successfully created in Prometric but not in CRM which caused the application to remain in draft status. May we confirm that these 2 candidates will be taking assessment on 09 June 2025 and there are no more other candidates impacted? Thank you.
24586 • unknown • NaT • Hi Cheryl, yes, both Xin Hwei and Lisa are taking the remote assessment on 9 Jun 2025. You may also like to note that 20250500111 and 20250500098 are still reflected as draft in CRM but application has been created in Prometric. For kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, her appln has been created in Prometric but not reflected in CRM
24796 • unknown • NaT • Hi Kah Boon, may we confirm if both leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg and lisa_loo@wsg.gov.sg is Singaporean, PR or Foreigner for us to proceed backend? For candidate kohseehwa77@hotmail.com, it is reflected as Draft in Prometric and OA Failed in CRM.
24801 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, @Cheryl As discussed with Kah Boon, we’ve conducted an investigation into the two candidates whose assessments are scheduled in Prometric but are still showing as drafts in CRM. Among them, only leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg has not attempted the assessment, and this application remains in draft status. This aligns with the root cause analysis provided by Joy. Next Step: As of 10 June, Kah Boon has confirmed that the only impacted candidate is leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg. @Joycelyn Goh Kindly review and proceed to have Intelegain trigger the API via Postman to update the application status accordingly. Thank you.

The behavior occurred when a PDF was opened through one of the external links within the OPEN-BOOK-TAB, and an attempt was made to download it.\n\nWhile the Secure Browser is generally capable of capturing download events within the OPEN-BOOK-TAB, this particular scenario—involving a download triggered by an externally linked PDF—is more complex and is currently not being detected by the browser.\n\nAs a result, the Secure Browser became unresponsive. Addressing this will require deeper analysis and additional development time to ensure such events can be reliably handled moving forward.\n

24915 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi Rachael and @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor's current recommendation as per the questions mentioned by @Eunice Chiang below are: 1. Question: How should the candidate resume the EA assessment? Can she use the same link in the competency assessment details email? Vendor’s Answer: Yes , the candidate can use the same link from the Competency Assessment Details email to resume the EA assessment. 2. Question: Are her answers from the attempt saved in the system or candidate has to reattempt from the beginning? Vendor’s Answer: The assessment will resume from the last saved progress . Do let us know if you require further clarification on this issue.
24996 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Candidate has feedback on the bottom: Upon clicking the same link to enter the EA exam, I am unable to click on the ""Start Assessment"" button. Nothing happened and it's not loading at all. Please check in with Prometric and provide a solution by end of today thank you.
25020 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25082 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting, We are still currently awaiting a follow-up from Prometric by 20th June EOD.
25117 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Since candidate is unable to proceed with the existing EA link from the previous competency email, we have requested Prometric Team on the following: 1. We’re attempting to regenerate the email to the candidate so she can retry accessing the EA link. However, I noticed there isn’t an option to resend the competency email. Pending their advice on this. 2. Pending Prometric Team to confirm whether their team has logs of the candidate’s EA attempt, particularly the instance where she attempted but did not submit as per their investigation. 3. Lastly, if this issue cannot be resolved, we have requested their team to help remove the current EA entry so the candidate can reattempt her EA. We will keep you updated again.
25179 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has removed the existing EA entry for the candidate. She can now try to take the exam again. Do advise to use the old EA Link for her to attempt the EA again. Please let us know if you require further assistance, and follow up if further issues arise. Thank you.
25193 • unknown • NaT • Shu Ting: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the information. @Rachael, we have replied to the candidate and will be closing this ticket thank you.
25609 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Candidate wrote in on 2 July to inform us that she has issues with the attempt of the experience assessment. She has two records: one sent on 26 February 2024, and another triggered on 25 October 2024 for a “complimentary reassessment of the Experience Assessment.” As noted in the screenshot shared in my previous email, the 25 October 2024 link shows no record. She is checking if she should proceed with the link sent on 26 February 2024? Please reach out to Prometric urgently as this issues has been pending since May thank you.
25641 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has reverted to us and let us know that the candidate can try now—it’s working. The issue occurred due to a configuration error when we handled this candidate’s data from the backend. This has been resolved. Let me if any further issues arise. Thank you.
25642 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the updates. We will close this ticket once the candidate has completed the Experience Assessment thank you.
26149 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan and @Eunice Chiang , The candidate revert yesterday with the same no record found issue, please look into it urgently. Candidate would like to request for a link since she has faced repeating issues with the old one. Thank you.
26268 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We were given two options to: 1. Remove the draft application from the backend, and the specialization does NOT change. 2. Remove the entire entry if the candidate wants to change the specialization. We have selected the first one as of now, and Prometric will verify and let us know on this asap, before we can proceed to the candidate. After verification from them, you may ask the candidate if she wants to change her specialization from ""Compensation Benefits/Total Rewards"". We will revert here once verification is completed. Thank you!.
26334 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has verified that upon clicking the previous link it will work. You may proceed to ask the candidate if she would like to change her specialization or stick with her current one, which is ""Compensation Benefits/Total Rewards"", which she previously selected. If she would like to change her specialization, please revert to us again as we need approval from BUs to remove the entry. Otherwise, if not, she may proceed to retry. If the issue still does not work, you may proceed to escalate to us again. Thank you.
26354 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information, we will follow up with the candidate before reverting.
26394 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , The candidate would like to change the specialization please check in with A&I for approval and escalate this thank you. FYI @Eunice Chiang

26419 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting, Pending Sachrit's response, will ping him immediately. Thank you.
26420 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Sachrit has reverted and approved to remove the second entry. We will proceed to ask the vendor and revert if they have done so. Thank you.
26444 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Rachael and @Shu Ting Ang , To recap, to proceed with changing the EA specialisation, we will need to cancel the current application and submit a new one. The following steps are required: 1. Remove the application in Prometric 2. Deactivate the Reassessment application in CRM (application no. 20240200385_1) 3. No payment transfer is needed, as there is no payment made for the reassessment (confirmed by Finance Team) 4. BU to recreate the Reassessment application in Prometric using CR 4 Please note that point 1 is completed. May I request BU to proceed with step 2 onwards and leave a remark for this action. Feel free to reach out if assistance is required.
26489 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Waiting on BU to create reassessment application for candidate.
26587 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice and Hasan, We have verified the application created by Rachael, we will close this ticket and reopen it if the candidate still face any issues. Thank you.

27524 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Chaser sent - Prometric to share an update by today. @Muhammad Hasan , please assist to follow up closely.
27556 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , vendor has confirmed that they reset the results on their end and attempted to enter the assessment and it was successful. Please assist to inform candidate to retry. Kindly ensure that candidate is using the EA link from the email dated 16-07-2025.
27700 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, thanks. I will inform the candidate to retry accordingly.
27927 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, providing you an update that candidate managed to complete her reassessment of EA and passed. She is certified on 11/08/2025. This case can be closed at L1 end.
27952 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Cheryl, Thanks for the update! We will get vendor to provide an update on what was done differently this time that the candidate was able to proceed. We need to ensure that the steps taken to rectify such cases are properly documented so we can respond swiftly to such cases in future. Thereafter, i will close the ticket here.
28257 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Vendor has confirmed that issue reoccurred because candidate re-clicked the EA link before entry was being removed by the vendor, which created a new record. After removing the new entry, the candidate was able to proceed and complete the EA. With that, we can proceed to close this case.

24804 • unknown • NaT • Agent in Fresdesk - Alisha
24812 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: HI @Shu Ting Ang , Please note that this is a technical issue , stands from the lack of optimization capabilities to handle voice events detected during assessment. Please proceed to work with BU to reschedule for the candidate and recommend candidate to do her/his assessment in a room with no loud background noises if possible. Root cause: The vendor has completed a detailed review of the logs and observed that the Voice Detection (VD) events for this candidate were triggered very frequently. We are currently validating the case further, as such a high volume of VD triggers is leading to performance degradation, particularly on the candidate’s side, resulting in potential memory issues. In this candidate’s case, the unusually high frequency of VD triggers appears to have caused memory strain, which likely led to the screen freezing during submission. Regarding the two proposed solutions: Optimizing VD Handling Pros: Improves overall efficiency without limiting detection functionality; ensures smoother experience across all candidates. Cons: May require more development and testing time to roll out safely across environments. Effort: Medium to High – involves changes to detection logic and performance benchmarking. Introducing a Trigger Threshold Pros: Quick to implement; effectively prevents system overload in edge cases. Cons: May reduce the granularity of monitoring beyond the defined threshold; needs careful calibration. Effort: Low to Medium – a configuration-level update with defined impact boundaries. We are still working closely with the vendor to resolve the issue and will keep L1 posted once issue has been resolved. FYI @Muhammad Hasan please note on this.
24928 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Alisha Shaikh @Muhammad Hasan Please follow up as Eunice has communicated. Include a note after you have reach out to BU and the date for the fix.

Problem:
Candidate (email: anita_and_chandra@yahoo.com.sg ) said she applied for the wrong cert level and was supposed to take her assessment on 19 March. On 17 March Shelby had replied candidate and asked her to cancel her CA appln, then applied for CP. Candidate did not act on it. Please advise process if candidate wishes to continue the certification and apply for CP instead? thank you.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24414 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Based on your description, the candidate would not be able to cancel her CA assessment scheduled for 19 March, even though she wrote in 17 March. As per policy, cancellation should be made no later than ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled assessment date or start date of remote assessment window This would therefore be considered a no-show application. If the candidate intends to apply for the IHRP-CP, she will first need to settle the outstanding SFC claim of $272.50. Once payment is received, we can proceed to cancel the application in Prometric and initiate the cancellation of the paid application to allow her to reapply. We hope this clarifies the situation. Please let us know if any further action is required on our end. Thank you.

As the candidate now wishes to reattempt CP, she may proceed accordingly (refer to CR 2025-001). Kindly request the BUs to deactivate application 20220900095. Once the candidate has reapplied, the BUs should reactivate 20220900095 and include an internal note in the application.

Please refer to my email today with the above title. \nCandidate's name: Kai Ling Ong\nEmail: ongkailing@live.com\n\nHer Competency details email requested her to do EA. She has a recognised Specialist Diploma from Nanyang Poly which exempts her from EA. Please advise ow to rectify this? can Prometric update the status backend?

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24568 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shelby, Following up on the candidate’s case, I’ve consulted with the L2 team and confirmed that the issue stems from an incorrect selection made during the application process. As a result, the candidate is not eligible for exemption at this stage. To proceed correctly, the candidate should select “IHRP Recognised Qualification” under the “Other” category and indicate the relevant institution to qualify for exemption from the EA. Kindly advise the candidate to cancel the current application and reapply with the appropriate selection. Additionally, as discussed with both Kah Boon and Rabiah, please note that on-site assessments are not available for exemption assessments. Should the candidate wish to reapply, the remote assessment option must be selected. Thank you for your assistance.

Hi all,\n\nCould we kindly confirm whether this application was cancelled by the candidate on 16/05/2025, as indicated in the audit history?\n\nThis appears unusual, as the assessment date was 14/05/2025, and our understanding is that the system should not permit candidates to cancel their applications after the assessment has taken place.

24786 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang Please refer to the screenshot from finance: Hi DTO Team, Could you please help confirm whether this application was cancelled by the candidate himself on 16/05/2025, as reflected in the audit history? This seems unusual as the assessment date was 14/05/2025, and our understanding is that the system should not allow candidates to cancel their applications after the assessment date. Additionally, based on the attached email from the company, candidate stated that he did not initiate the cancellation request, yet the assessment was cancelled. Appreciate your urgent clarification on what actually happened please, as this may affect the billing. Thank you.
24829 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Your understanding is aligned with us. We have raised this ticket to the vendor logged under . We will work closely with the vendor and keep you updated again.
24917 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang We have concluded the investigation confirmed that the cancellation was initiated by the Candidate from the IHRP Portal. As to why candidate was able to do so, the vendor discovered that when the dashboard landing page is loading, the 'Cancel' button will lit up as the JavaScript in place takes a few moments to disable the cancel button. During this delay, if the user clicks the cancel button, the application gets cancelled. To avoid this issue and ensure a smoother user experience, we need to update the logic so that the cancel button is either hidden or disabled immediately upon page load. We will work with the vendor on this and provide an update once the fix has been deployed.
24931 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice thank you for the information. We have informed Finance, currently pending the fix in logic therefore we will keep it as investigation in progress.

The candidate wants to retake his EA, but is unable to, because it indicates that he already passed the EA, although he did not attempt it and there was no email sent to him to retake only his EA after he made payment. Candidate’s claim as per the screenshot attached:

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24849 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: We are currently awaiting a follow-up from Prometric. This case could be closely related to , a ticket that already has been deployed on 29th May 2025. FYI @shu ting.
24933 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Please send a chaser to follow up with Prometric thank you.
25033 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi Shu Ting and Hasan, We had a call with the vendor earlier, here is a summary of the key points discussed and the actions pending from vendor: 1. The candidate claims that he has not attempted the Reassessment (EA Component only), stating that the email containing the access link was not received. As confirmed during our discussion, this was due to a technical issue, as explained by Prometric. 2. However, both the masterlist report and the EA detailed report show a completed EA score and recorded responses. Based on our conversation, this record is likely from the candidate’s initial assessment, suggesting that the EA was attempted twice in February 2025. Pending vendor to confirm whether this scenario is accurate based on their investigation and system logs. 3. If the above is verified, vendor will advise whether the following actions are feasible: a. Remove the entire Reassessment entry and have IHRP create a new reassessment application for the candidate. b. Remove only the EA record, allowing the candidate to reattempt the Reassessment EA. Requested Prometric Team to get back by 18/6 EOD as candidate is pending a reply from IHRP.
25096 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , May I check if there is any follow up from the vendor?
25118 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has reverted yesterday and confirmed that candidate did attempt EA twice on two occasions. However, since both records likely equates to a 'Pass' mark, we will need to confirm with Prometric if these two attempts are considered as one. If that is the case, we need to route the case to Sachrit for his approval to remove the 2nd EA record on the basis of: 1. Candidate attempted EA twice using the same link, once in Feb and once in Mar - which is not allowed. 2. Candidate did not complete EA in one sitting as per instructions. Decision will be on A&I for the candidate's next steps. We will update on this again.
25180 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Sachrit has followed up and mentioned that it is okay to remove the second entry for the candidate. We are currently waiting for Prometric to remove the entry so that the candidate can perform his reassessment for EA. We will keep you updated on this.
25347 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Any updates on the above?
25377 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Still awaiting a reply from Prometric, I have already sent a chaser yesterday.
25412 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have already sent out an email to the candidate, whereby Prometric has already removed the entry for the candidate to attempt the EA. We will wait for the candidate to revert back if there are any issues. If there are no issues, we can close this ticket.
25443 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Candidate has feedback that no record was found upon clicking the original link for EA. I have sent a chaser to Prometric for them further investigate this issue. Please refer to Jira for screenshots.
25510 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The candidate has managed to attempt the EA after fixing a mapping issue was resolved from the vendor's end. You may proceed to close this ticket.
25575 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Hasan, Thank you for the information. We will close the ticket.

25022 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25080 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , For this candidate, it is advised to: 1. Ensure that when the screen sharing prompt appears, they select the ""Entire Screen"" option and then click ""Share"". 2. For Mac users, verify that screen recording access is enabled for the Secure Browser. 3. Close any applications that might conflict with screen sharing (e.g., MS Teams, Zoom). 4. Use a single monitor setup if possible, or select the primary screen if using dual monitors. 5. Restart the system before launching the Secure Browser again. We are currently awaiting for an e-help transcript from Piyush.
25088 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , I have reviewed the ehelp transcript and concluded that this is a user issue. Please note that MAC devices typically requires additional step for the set up, and the candidate do not know how to allow such permissions on his/her personal device. The ehelp agent has also advised to look for Screen Sharing permissions on device (though not explicit). This is the possible step that candidate should have done: macOS Screen Recording Permission (For Mac users): -Even in Secure Browser mode, macOS requires manual screen recording permission to be granted under: -System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Screen Recording -Without this, screen sharing cannot proceed—even if the user selects a screen. Please note on this and prompt if BU would like to add this information onto the ehelp documentation page for candidate to prepare for the assessment. If there are no further queries, please proceed to close the case and route to BU for follow up. FYI @Shu Ting Ang - if its a case to route to BU, please confirm if Hasan should hand this over to your team.
25099 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. Hi @Muhammad Hasan , We will be following up on this case.

26682 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , The candidate has attempt the steps but the promo code still do not work. Kindly refer to the screenshot and assist thank you.
26717 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have raised this to the vendor and will update again once we have any findings. I will provide an update by tomorrow.
26748 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We will be adding the impacted candidate to the list here.
26752 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Can you confirm that both gerald.wu@gmail.com and moonling9009@yahoo.com is facing this issue?
26763 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have confirmed with the vendor and also tested on our end that there are no issues with the Promo Code API and the usability of this API. In that case, we would like to request for a call together with our vendor and the candidate to troubleshoot this. May i suggest to hop on a call with Gerald to validate first? Please let us know candidate preferred time, and preferably in the noon so the vendor can accommodate easily.
26799 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We will follow up with the candidate regarding the pending matter. Additionally, please note that the second candidate, Loh Mun Ling, has submitted the application without applying the promo code. Thank you.
27004 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , We have reached out to the candidate, pending the confirmation from the candidate and I have bcc you loop cheryl in thank you.
27458 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , Following up from the call with the candidate, the vendor has confirmed that the root cause is likely due to the missing 'Assessment Schedule Date' field which was identified to be 'null' during the call. Due to the missing field, the API was unable to be called. As such, we have added the talview assessment date onto this field. After candidate has successfully applied for reassessment, this field will be overwritten accordingly. Please advice candidate to retry with the promo code and let us know if issue persists.
27579 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, Candidate: gerald.wu@gmail.com Draft has been deleted and we have inform candidate to try to apply again. I have also informed him to update us once he has successfully applied or still encountering any issues. Will follow up on this. Thank you
27805 • unknown • NaT • Cheryl: Hi Eunice, candidate has informed that he is able to use the promo code for his reassessment application. All good for now!
27820 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Cheryl , noted on that. It seems like this issue only occurs for Talview candidates who were migrated and are trying to use the promo code. In that case, we may have to configure the system logic to accomodate that. However, it seems like there are only 2 candidates with this issue so far, so we will plan this change and work on it in accordance to the priority list. In the meantime, we can proceed to close the ticket as moonling9009@yahoo.com has applied without the promo code. FYI @Joycelyn Goh , @Zac Tan @Muhammad Hasan - please note on this issue. Promo code is not usable for Migrated Talview candidates with 'Assessment schedule date' field empty. Refer to linked DC3P ticket for more info.
28086 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice, Adding to list for the impacted candidate with the same issues when using the promo code.

Hi All,\n\nName: Felicia Leong Xin Hwei\nEmail: leong_xin_hwei@moe.gov.sg\n\n\nThis pertains to the CSC candidate we previously discussed. Due to a technical issue, the candidate was provided with the Experience link; however, they are actually exempted, which led to the confusion.\n\nAdditionally, the candidate encountered issues while downloading the secure browser and reached out to ehelp but did not hear back from them. Could you please assist in identifying the microphone issue the candidate encountered and check the transcript with Prometric to understand why no assistance was provided during the session. Please refer to ticket 97562 for more information. \n\nThank you. \n

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
24892 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan please refer to this screenshot for more information. FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang Thank you.
24924 • unknown • NaT • ST: Need to change current status to submitted.
25004 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We found out that the candidate has faced an issue whereby they could not proceed past the microphone check. In the logs it was stated that the microphone could not be started because it is in use by another application, or the right permissions have not been set. You may refer to the screenshot: Here is what we are confirming with the vendor: If the issue could be similar to thread: E-Help Agent unavailable when candidate reached out - mtlee006@suss.edu.sg. - since the microphone is stated to be in use by another application. Letting us know if the candidate reached out to e-help. Once we receive a reply, I will follow up accordingly. FYI @Joycelyn Goh , @Eunice Chiang .
25023 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric is currently looking into the issue and will revert to us soon with their findings. Do let us know if you have further clarifications.
25081 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Prometric has advised that: Close all other applications that might be using the microphone. Ensure microphone access is enabled for both the operating system and the secure browser. Confirm that the microphone volume is not muted or set to zero. Restart the system before launching the test to release any mic locks from other applications. We are currently awaiting an e-help transcript from Prometric.
25087 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have received the ehelp transcript and here are our findings: 1. Candidate claimed that she has to do EA in her competency assessment details email. However, based on her application details, she is exempted from EA. We have also validated this in Production - EA will not be assigned if user selected 'CSC HR Foundation Programme' during EC. 2. Candidate seemed to be unclear with how to proceed with assessment. Advice candidate to use personal device and IHRP registered email for assessment. 3. Misinformation regarding the need to attempt EA from Agniv (ehelp support agent) will be escalated and addressed to Prometric Team. Separately, based on the transcript, it appears the candidate is experiencing difficulty starting her assessment, as she mentioned needing to complete the EA beforehand. However, according to her application details, she is exempt from the EA requirement. Additionally, we’ve observed that she was able to initiate the environment and system check – which is why she had issues with her microphone (tracked in logs). We will confirm with Prometric Team if this understanding is aligned and update again.
25101 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information, we will wait for Prometric to revert.
25184 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The vendor has responded and confirmed the following points: 1. The candidate initially received the competency assessment details via her Outlook work email in May. She later forwarded the email to her Gmail account in June, prior to the assessment. During this forwarding process, due to differences in how email clients render HTML, some content was corrupted—resulting in the EA Link appearing in the Gmail version. According to the vendor, this is not a technical issue but rather a limitation outside our control. That said, the vendor will explore whether such scenarios can be programmatically addressed. 2. The original email (without the EA link) is the correct version, and the candidate should have been aware of her assessment components. 3. The eHelp agents responded based on the issue the candidate repeatedly raised—namely, that the ""EA Link is not working""—and thus their troubleshooting was focused accordingly. 4. Despite these issues, the candidate successfully accessed the secure browser (as the EA was not required and the paper assignment was accurate), but was ultimately unable to proceed due to a microphone issue. Given the above, I recommend that the BU consider supporting her reschedule request, as the confusion stemmed from the email forwarding. We will follow up regarding the HTML rendering during email forwarding (if its feasible) else we update again to close the ticket for monitoring. Original (Outlook) - sent from Prometric Forwarded to Gmail - from Outlook
25195 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information, we will inform cert team to reschedule her assessment due to all the leading issues. Please let us if there is any update upon following up on the HTML rendering during email forwarding so that we can close the ticket for monitoring thank you.
25427 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has responded that they will try to get back by 4th July. However, based on the situation, this could be a CR. Hence, propose to keep this ticket closed for monitoring and note this as an internal note that forwarded emails from different email client may have HTML rendering issues, and EA section may be corrupted in that way. Though it may not happen in all cases (did not happen to me in when I tried to replicate Outlook>Gmail), as such issues is not within Prometric Team's control at the moment.
25431 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice, Thank you for the information. We will close this ticket for monitoring.
26137 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we have closed this ticket on our end for monitoring, as there is no resolution to this, since the issue is beyond our control. I have already sent out an email to L1s to identify the issue under the thread: Candidates face Email rendering issues when forwarded - . You may refer to that if you face emails like these. The screenshots of an example of unrendered email will be attached in Jira again for your reference. Thank you.

25089 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Zac Tan , Please attempt to look into this issue.
25114 • unknown • NaT • Zac: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I have checked with the vendor and conclude this is a ""User Issue"". The secure browser is working fine, and other candidates had no issues. The candidate likely blocked camera/mic permissions or had device issues such as disconnected hardware, privacy settings, antivirus interference, or other apps (like MsTeams) using the devices. If they used an external webcam or mic, it must be connected, up to date drivers recognised by the OS and working before launching the secure browser. Recommended next steps: Ask the candidate to check device connection and permissions, ensure privacy settings allow camera/mic use for all apps, try using a different device or user account, verify no other apps are using the webcam/mic, and restart the computer with devices reconnected before launching the secure browser.

Hi all, This candidate has faced an issue whereby she could not access the Secure Browser due to having a VPN. This issue is related to We are currently reaching out to Prometric to find more details about this regarding the e-help transcript. Thank you. E-Help Transcript:

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
25213 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , This candidate has been added into the impact list in . I have reached out to e-help, and they have come back with the following: 1. Ask the candidate to connect to a home or personal internet network, avoiding office/corporate/VPN-secured connections. 2. Ensure VPN is completely disabled. 3. Restart the system and relaunch Secure Browser after switching networks. For Windows: 1. Check if Windows Defender Firewall or any third-party antivirus (like McAfee, Norton, etc.) is blocking the Secure Browser. Add an exception for the application. 2. Disable VPN or proxy settings from Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy. 3. Avoid public or office Wi-Fi networks. You may refer to the screenshots in Jira for the e-help transcript.
25220 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the discussion, please check in with Prometric whether the solution was given to the candidate and any follow up by end of today thank you.
25245 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , here is the root cause and solutions for the issue Root Cause: Candidate faced issues with accessing the Secure Browser because she had a VPN. With a LAN Port or VPN running the background, candidates will be unable to proceed into the Secure Browser. Solution: This current ticket is related to , where a sub-line was added: “ Please ensure you are not connected via a LAN or VPN "", and where VPN network access was blocked. These two tickets have already been deployed on 25th June 2025, and 29th May 2025 respectively. Next Steps: Please navigate to the BUs to see if they feel that this issue is eligible for rescheduling since we already have deployed the tickets as resolutions for past issues similar to this. Thank you.
25345 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Thank you for the information. We will route this case to the certification team for review.
25410 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Referring to the response provided by agent Agniv K, which stated that candidates can reschedule their assessments, we’ve since received multiple complaints—particularly in cases where candidates are asked to cover the rescheduling fee. To prevent any miscommunication to the candidates, we have formally requested Prometric team to adopt this new process and standard reply. For any candidate enquiries related to assessment rescheduling or matters beyond the Prometric Team’s scope, the following standard response will be used: “For escalation of matters relating to assessment, please reach out to hello@ihrp.sg for further assistance.” Confirmed with L1 on wording.

25646 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We have proceeded to close this ticket and will send out an email to let L1s know how to revert to candidates when they face issues like these. Here is what we found and the solutions we will do: Context: Recently, a few candidates have encountered issues where the EA link appears in forwarded emails, even though they were not assigned EA. This discrepancy is due to how emails are rendered when forwarded. Identified Problem: Candidates may have configured email forwarding in various ways: When an email is sent to the candidate , it involves forwarding to multiple clients (e.g., Outlook and Gmail simultaneously from the candidate's end) Setting up email forwarding within the same email client Any direct forwarding of emails to any other email As a result, the competency email may display the EA link in the forwarded version, but not in the original. Next Steps: As confirmed by the vendor, this issue is not within our control, and the vendor is still exploring ways to manage such scenarios. In the meantime, please follow these steps: Ask the candidate to provide a screenshot of the competency email sent to them (must include to and from — highlighted in yellow). Verify the recipient’s email address using the screenshot, and check for any mismatch in CRM and Prometric. Check Prometric to confirm EA assignment status: ✅ If EA is assigned and the forwarded email contains the EA link → No action needed. ❌ If EA is not assigned but the forwarded email contains the EA link → Inform candidate to refer to the original email sent from donotreply@assessment.prometric.com OR refer to the version sent to the IHRP registered email address. IF emails are not delivered, you may request the L2 to ask for the delivery status of the competency email. If you need further clarification, feel free to reach out. Thank you.
25647 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , May I check in on the 3 point that you are checking with Prometric? 3. Thirdly, please provide whether the competency assessment details were initially delivered. Appreciate if you can revert by today as it is pending for sometime thank you.
25651 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Apologies for not attaching the candidate's screenshots, but you may refer to the screenshots attached in Jira. The initial email that was sent out was blocked as noticed by the handle: courts-com-sg.mail.protection.outlook.com, hence the candidate could not receive competency details. The EA Link is present due to a rendering issue as mentioned below, due to the forwarding of emails. You may let her know that she can ignore the link because in our system, she is not assigned EA, since she already initially passed. Hope this clarifies! Thank you.

While doing testing in prod, the team faced an issue where the secure browser became unresponsive after opening a PDF from the external URL and trying to download the file.\n\n-- Initial Analysis by Prometric --\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\nI’ve investigated the issue and identified the root cause. The behavior occurred when a PDF was opened through one of the external links within the OPEN-BOOK-TAB, and an attempt was made to download it.\n\nWhile the Secure Browser is generally capable of capturing download events within the OPEN-BOOK-TAB, this particular scenario—involving a download triggered by an externally linked PDF—is more complex and is currently not being detected by the browser.\n\nAs a result, the Secure Browser became unresponsive. Addressing this will require deeper analysis and additional development time to ensure such events can be reliably handled moving forward

25379 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Ticket deployed on 26/6/25 Production testing results attached in Jira. Issue to be monitored: The PDF within the expandable file can be downloaded and saved locally. However, this is not a showstopper, as the candidate is accessing materials from an external site and will not be able to retrieve this source within the secure browser. Additionally, the candidate should still have access to all resources available on the site. Vendor (Ayush) has confirmed that this occurred because the ‘Save As’ window was permitted to prevent the screen from freezing in Secure Browser. As a result, restricting the download functionality is not feasible in this case, since Secure Browser cannot override the default PDF viewing behavior.

25433 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joycelyn Goh Vidhya spotted the recertification application below 20250300300 as the status is draft, but payment has been made (STRIPE screenshot below) in Mar 2025. For this case, as the status is draft, the application has not been reviewed, and the latest e-certificate has not been sent. Kindly advise thank you.
25435 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, this is seems to be a separate issue. A new ticket has been logged with the vendor.

25668 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh , May I check if there is any update on this?
25671 • unknown • NaT • Hi Shu Ting, our vendor has completed their analysis. Findings We have attempted to replicate the scenario from our end but were unable to reproduce the issue. Additionally, we reviewed the system logs, Power Automate flows, and API calls. From our analysis, it is likely that either: 1. The user had already submitted the application before clicking the button again, or 2. There was a temporary network glitch that caused the action to be processed incorrectly It is likely that (2) there was a glitch in the power automate flow due to the time period when the status was reverted. As this appears to be an isolated case, we recommend monitoring the situation in production. With BUs confirmation, we will proceed to manually rectify the application status from ""Draft"" to ""Submitted"". Please let me know before i proceed.
25679 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joy, Thank you for the information. Please allow me to check in with Kah Boon. Hi Kah Boon, Please find the findings below and the possible cause, kindly confirm if we can proceed to manually rectify the application status from ""Draft"" to ""Submitted""? Thank you.

25773 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joy. Please find Kah Boon's confirmation to manually rectify the application status from ""Draft"" to ""Submitted"". Appreciate if you can let us know once it has been updated thank you.

26040 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Rachael, We’ve looked into the issue where a candidate’s reassessment application is showing up in Prometric, but not in the CRM system. Also, it looks like their payment didn’t go through in Stripe, even though the logs show the process was marked as successful. We’re currently investigating this with the vendors to understand how the candidate was approved and had a slot created without a completed payment. For now, we’re waiting on the vendors to look into it further. Once they confirm whether it’s a technical issue or a user-related one, we’ll let you know the next steps to rectify it. Thank you.

25662 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Muhammad Hasan , Name: Lim Cyril Email: cyril.lim@tenderfresh.com.sg Current status: CRM-OA Failed (HR Competency Paper - 0 marks) This candidate faces some issues during his assessment on 1 July. Additionally, the candidate has requested to expedite the process and reschedule their assessment. They have a very tight schedule and are only available on 9 July or 1 August. While the first issue may be related to the user's hardware, the second appears to be a technical error that has previously occurred when papers were submitted before completion. Please find the full information in Jira. Do let us know if you require any additional clarification or screenshots that are missing. Please look into this case urgently thank you. From candidate: Hi Shelby and Vidhya, As spoken at IHRP office earlier today at around 12.40pm, as requested, kindly find below the details of the issues I faced. I have attached the various emails I received and the email thread with the both of you. Issue with screen sharing at 9.00am After keying in the access code into the IHRP secure browser on my MacBook Air, I tried clicking onto the screen share button below since 9.00am but to no avail. My MacBook Air's technical configurations meets all the requirements and I allowed access to all location, camera, microphone, screen permissions, etc. I searched https://ehelp.prometric.com/ihrp/s/ but found that the link does not help me with the issue I face. The chat was also offline. I tried to contact IHRP but no contact number was provided. Attempting the Labour Legislation Paper close to 10.00am It was only around close to 10.00am that I managed to attempt the labour legislation paper after I tried to look for other computers and managed to get 1 working. Even so, I cleared the system check on the other computer but when I was at the environment and security check, I waited for around 5-10 mins on the screen below before proctor 4 logged in and viewed my surrounding to allow me to attempt
25708 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we have noticed that the candidate faced a few issues: 1. During the optional break, the test was automatically submitted even though the candidate did not touch anything. 2. The candidate initially faced screen sharing issues with the Mac but was able to proceed after using a different laptop. This case is related to , so we will not need to investigate that. 3. E-Help was offline initially when the candidate tried to reach out between 9-10am. However, she was able to contact an agent in the afternoon. Here's what we're checking with Prometric: 1. Why the HR Paper was automatically submitted during the optional break, which caused the candidate to fail the HR Paper without attempting it and did not manage to finish the optional break. 2. Why E-Help was offline initially, and providing us an e-help transcript. In the meantime, please proceed to waiver the reassessment for the candidate since he faced a major technical issue which we will need to investigate. Do reach out if you have any further clarifications or assistance needed. Thank you.
25745 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @ Hasan, Thank you for the information, we will inform the BU to proceed with proceed to waiver the reassessment for the candidate since he faced a major technical issue which we will need to investigate.

26699 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Chaser sent to vendor.
26730 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently the identified root cause was that the candidate submitted the test at exactly zero seconds remaining, causing a double submission that led to unexpected behavior in the system, including submission status inconsistencies and candidate confusion. However, we suspected that this issue could be related to . We are confirming if: 1. Is this candidate facing the issue faced in 2. The candidate is facing a different issue because the candidate really did submit the paper as the timer runs out, causing double submissions as the test is also automatically submitted by the system. We will revert with our findings as soon as they get back to us. Thank you.
27005 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Hasan, Any updates on the above? Thank you.
27017 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The issue faced by the candidate was indeed related to , but since the candidate submitted the test at exactly zero seconds remaining, it is slightly different. Please take note that this indeed a technical issue faced by the candidate, since it was a double submission. You may advise that the candidate should not submit the test at exactly zero seconds.

25938 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Currently we're investigating a few things from the vendor: 1.

26039 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We are checking in with Intelegain with this issue under , where the issue is similar, I have added a comment under there, and will revert here with further issues.
26404 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Shu Ting Ang , I sent a chaser to Intelegain on this.
26448 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Chaser sent to ITG.
26532 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: ITG has confirmed that the issue arise due to the an API that was not called - ""Update Payment Status"". They are currently how this happened and will provide an update. We have also requested for an impact list for the users who had this error log. Issue is tracked under .
26593 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Vendor has confirmed that issue stemmed from a failure in the API call during the “Update Payment Status” process and its associated API flows. This resulted in both statuses not updated. However, they are not able to replicate the issue to resolve it. We will collaborate closely with the vendor to compile an impact list, if feasible. Additionally, we will explore ways to enhance the reliability of the payment process and support future troubleshooting efforts, such as improving the existing codebase by implementing detailed parameter-level logging. This enhancement will enable us to capture and review all relevant inputs, making it easier to identify any missing or null values. I have dropped Finance Team an email on the following action required: 1. @Finance Team to validate payment is received by IHRP 2. DTO Team to work with vendor to pull the information from logs and fill in the missing fields (to be validated by @Finance Team using postman) a. Price and Transaction details (as per the amount received) b. Fee List Item c. Payment By d. Transaction Details (stripe record) 3. DTO Team to work with vendor to change application status back to ‘Submitted’ 4. DTO Team to work with vendor to change application status to ‘OA-Failed’ – candidate has completed assessment today.
26640 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, Thank you for the update, we will be referring to the email to Finance to follow up on this thank you.
26747 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Eunice, We would like to follow up on this case to know if it can be resolved thank you.
26804 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang Issue fix is on hold till we have hours procured. Rectification data shared with Finance for validation. Once that is verified, the vendor will assist to update in the application in CRM. We will update once that is done.
27262 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Cheryl , We have reinstated the application details in CRM and routed this to Finance for verification. However, during the issuance of invoice, the initial invoice had an incorrect payment date. May we have your assistance to inform candidate of the discrepancy, and advise her to refer to the latest invoice with the correct payment date. Please refer to the SS of the 2 invoice sent.
27467 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Eunice Chiang , do I wait for confirmation on verification from Finance before I reach out to candidate? I will advise candidate to refer to invoice sent on 28/07/2025 at 3:19pm.

We are asking for them to have a plan such that post-assessment issues should be routed to IHRP for service recovery Feel free to reach out if you have further clarifications. Thank you.

I noted that this candidate OA-Failed for CA but applied new for CP and passed. In that case, since the CR for applying new cert when you have a previously OA-Failed application is not live in CRM, BU has to use the workaround which is to deactivate the OA-Failed application (with necessary approval) and proceed to allow candidate to apply. Then, reactivate the application again. @Joycelyn Goh kindly assist to confirm.

26459 • unknown • NaT • This issue has been affecting candidates since last year, where the macOS ‘Messages’ application runs in the background and interferes with the launch of the secure browser used for assessments. Our current workaround has been to instruct candidates to use the Force Quit function to terminate the application. However, we’ve recently discovered that this method does not effectively kill the ‘Messages’ process. Instead, candidates must manually open Activity Monitor, locate the ‘Messages’ process, and force quit it from there. This is not as straightforward as using a typical Task Manager and can be confusing or time-consuming for candidates, especially those unfamiliar with macOS system tools. We are raising this ticket to clarify the following with relevant business units: 1. What is the role of the ‘Messages’ process in relation to the secure browser? 2. Why does it interfere with the browser’s launch? 3. Is there a workaround or enhancement that can be implemented to prevent this issue from recurring? 4. Can the secure browser be improved to handle this process more gracefully or provide clearer guidance to candidates? Attachments and examples will be provided to support this issue.
26492 • unknown • NaT • Hi all, We are currently creating a comprehensive guide for installation that requires three things: 1. Enabling Cameras 2. Screen Sharing Permissions 3. Working around Kill Message Prompts by using Activity Monitor I will follow up here for further updates on the document here.

28227 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , We are developing a step-by-step installation guide for candidates. This is not considered as operational issues, but more of an internal process fix of laptops. Feel free to reach out if you require further clarification. Thank you.

26592 • unknown • NaT • Joy- Hi Shu Ting, just to note the analysis of the candidate's journey below: 1. The candidate was part of the old assessment flow of EA then OA. 2. The candidate took EA, failed it. According to the old workflow, by right this candidate would bump down to CP. 3. However, this candidate was already CP certified in 2019 hence, this could be the reason why her SP certification journey ended so abruptly with IHRP. It is important that we confirm this analysis with Cert team. Kindly help to reach out to the requestor to ensure that we are aligned on the candidate's certification journey. Once we are aligned, i will provide the recommendation on the next step.
26644 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joy, Is the requestor the person who initially raised this issue? The candidate wrote in directly to Freshdesk, we will proceed to consult the certification team on this before reverting thank you.
26665 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh Please find Kah Boon comment below: ""Yes, Cheryl Tan has applied for the IHRP-SP upgrade application in 2022 and as she did not clear her EA, she is unable to proceed with the competency assessment. If she would like to apply for upgrade, would need L2 confirmation if her upgrade application must be deactivated. Thank you.""
26671 • unknown • NaT • Joy: Hi Shu Ting, in that case, the IHRP-SP application should first be deactivated to allow the candidate to submit a new application. An internal remark should be added to the application to document this. Once the candidate has submitted the new application, it can then be reactivated.
26681 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Joycelyn Goh Thank you for the information, we will close this ticket.

26490 • unknown • NaT • Joy - Hi Jia Rong, we were able to identify the root cause of the issue. Please find the findings below. Root Cause Whenever Apple releases a security update, it may cause compatibility issues with our secure browser. Interim Workaround Prometric team currently developing a new version of the secure browser for MacBook users. For candidates using MacBooks who have contacted eHelp or our team, we will provide them with the latest version to ensure they can proceed with their assessments. Long-Term Consideration While I recognise that Apple’s updates are unpredictable, it remains important for us to explore a sustainable long-term solution for MacBook users. We have requested the Prometric team to prioritise this matter and begin exploring viable options. Next Step Since this is a technical issue, please proceed with the necessary step with the candidate so that he can proceed with his certification journey with IHRP.
26493 • unknown • NaT • Hi @Joy, Thank you for the information, we will be pending for more updates on the latest version of the secure browser. Hi Jia Rong, I will be taking over this case thank you.

Candidate applies and completes the EC 2. Proceeds to the Payment Page 3. Clicks ‘Back’ to return to the EC 4. Continues pressing ‘Back’ until reaching the IHRP Portal 5. Clicks ‘Apply Now’ again in IHRP Portal 6. Lands on a confirmation page showing a past assessment date Pending vendor to investigate and propose a permanent resolution. Will update again.

26639 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Shelby, For this case, the issue differs from the others. Based on Kah Boon's comment, the candidate mistakenly submitted her application in Prometric for the 30 April assessment. The correct assessment should have been taken via Talview on 29 April 2024 (KB_24Apr24). We will proceed to delete the paid fresh application in Prometric before reverting. As the candidate’s data has already been migrated, she will be able to proceed with the reassessment after the deletion. Kindly note that the BU will need to remove the Assessment Schedule Date of 30 April 2024 in CRM and retain only the Talview slot. Thank you.

Evidence comments (id • author_role • date • text):
26736 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @ Hasan, Can you look into this as we have retriggered the access code but it is still showing IHRP-CA assessment. Thank you. FYI @Joycelyn Goh @Eunice Chiang
26759 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , There could be an issue with the wording template, there could be a discrepancy in the email template which led to this problem. We will investigate with the vendor and revert for any updates. As for the candidate, please tell her that she can proceed, we have noted that on our end, she already is assigned the correct paper. Should further issues arise, feel free to let me know. Thank you.
26767 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi Hasan, Thank you for the updates, may we confirm that the candidate is still taking the CP assessment despite the technical error indicated in the email before we revert back to the candidate? Thank you.
26768 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , Yes, we can confirm that she is indeed assigned the correct papers from the backend. It is just discrepancy in displaying the correct info in the email sent to the candidate. Hope this clarifies.

27823 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Cheryl , a chaser was sent yesterday. Will update here if there any updates from the vendor. Thank you.
27919 • unknown • NaT • Hasan: Hi @Cheryl , this issue related to POI-335, pending vendor's QA verification. Regarding POI-335, knowledge transfer has been provided for L1s through email previously. Should the candidate still be unsure, you may provide the knowledge given in the email. Thank you.
28052 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Hasan, Kindly elaborate on this knowledge transfer has been provided for L1s through email previously. In light of this, could you kindly clarify whether the vendor is able to implement a fix to prevent this issue from recurring? Additionally, we would like to highlight that sending an update email to a candidate who has already been certified may cause confusion. Please advise on how best to proceed in this case. Thank you.
28072 • unknown • NaT • Eunice: Hi @Shu Ting Ang , The KT that Hasan was referring to is on the thread titled: Candidates face Email rendering issues when forwarded - However, please allow us more time to review the case wholistically as the behaviour doesn't seem to be the same as the previous causes logged in POI 335. Based on my analysis and reviewing the candidate’s SS provided, there is no form of email forwarding performed. When L1 regenerated the access code to her Gmail account, the received email showed IHRP-CA instead of IHRP-CP. However, I noticed that the screenshot provided shows the email was opened using the ‘Mail’ app from the App Store, suggesting that her Gmail is linked to this app. With that, we dropped an email to Prometric to confirm whether such a setup could result in discrepancies in how the HTML content is displayed. If yes, then this will fall into the additional information and KT that we will share with L1 for such cases moving ahead. Regarding a permanent fix, please note that based on POI 335, it is very difficult to implement such a fix as there are many variables out of the vendor's capabilities now, and this is a UI issue that does not impact candidate's assessment journey. Regarding an update to candidate, I noticed that candidate has already completed her full assessment, hence, i suggest just providing an update that IHRP noted and acknowledged on this email UI issue, and is working on it internally. I don't see any further updates required to be shared with the candidate on this. With that, i suggest we close the case for monitoring and we will update L1 if there are additional KT information or no further action can be done. FYI @Muhammad Hasan , please take note on such details when you investigate. You are missing out the details in the candidate's SS.
28203 • unknown • NaT • ST: Hi @Eunice Chiang , Thank you for the information. We have informed the candidate that an internal fix is currently in progress. As mentioned, the candidate has successfully completed the assessment and is now certified. Accordingly, we will proceed to close this case for monitoring purposes. Thank you.

Since we have allowed either NRIC/ Passport as the identification type, the scenario where a user can hold 2 accounts is possible in the system.

As we have a workaround for this, we will look into this as P2 priority.

Problem:
Hi @Joycelyn Goh , 1) IHRP-CA certified candidates received recertification update email from hello@ihrp.sg . Recertification button is shown under the certification in the IHRP portal. When clicked the ‘Recertify Now’, the user is redirected to Prometric. 2) IHRP-CP certified candidates are facing a ‘existing active application in the system' prompt when clicking the recertification button. When the user clicks 'ok’, they are redirected to Prometric: 3) I have tried to replicate within the UAT, under the IHRP-CA Certification shows a recertification button, when clicked, redirects to the recertification page: These candidates are affected by the system flow: Candidate Name: Edna Wu Candidate Email: edna.wd@gmail.com Candidate Certification level: IHRP-CP Candidate Name: Mavi Belen Candidate Email: mavi.belen@surecomp.com Candidate Certification level: IHRP-CA

27263 • unknown • NaT • Joy: for (1), the recertification button will be enabled even for CA. This is the expected result. However, for CA certified professional who wishes to recert, they will see null value at payment summary page. For the main issue where the existing application pop-up is displayed upon clicking on recert - L2 i working with the vendor to understand the issue.
27689 • unknown • NaT • Joy: Alisha, the main issue has been resolved. Fix: Intelegain has updated the web template code. We have added the following condition: If the application is active, it will show the popup. If the application is active and the application status is Certified, it will not show the popup and will redirect to the recertification page Please let us know if there's further action required from L2.
